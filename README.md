# junh1024-Anime-stuffs

A collection of FFMPEG video scripts & audio projects for anime releases. Some of them are quite complex in the case of 5x > 7x+ upscaling, or cross language discretization. They fall in these categories:

- Single songs, to be used in series/movie projects
- TV series, a bit more uniform
- Movies, made solely for the movie
- After Effects (video) projects
- AMV  (video) projects

Some of them are accompanied by MIDI transcriptions or conversions. The conversions are meant to give a rough idea only. Many of them use my own tools from the Reaper-Surround repo. See NT for other details.

File formats:
- aepx Adobe After Effects project as XML
- RPP [REAPER](www.reaper.fm) audio project
- MID MIDI file (specifications available elsewhere on cathub)
- bat Windows batch
- avs Avisynth script

Songs used:
- Michael Jackson - Thriller
- Marvin Gaye - Ain't Nothing like the Real Thing (some lines removed @ end)
- Laura Pausini - The Extra Mile
- Claris - Connect
- SPEED - White Love
- Aya Hirano - Bouken Desho Desho
