Feedback for Clannad2:
[08:57:35] <@junh1024-XD> Squiggy did you get my highlight last night?
<&Squiggy> Um
<&Squiggy> Ah that was you
<&Squiggy> I was like comatose :D
<@junh1024-XD> you mean drunk?
<&Squiggy> Na
<&Squiggy> I was drunk before
<&Squiggy> And then comatose
<@junh1024-XD> have you got 9 mins to spare ?
<&Squiggy> tl;dr I slept
<&Squiggy> I think so yea
<&Squiggy> I can see it already
<&Squiggy> ( ¬‿¬)
<@junh1024-XD> http://www.mediafire.com/?iusk2hccqga89uq < can you please watch this (i made it) and make some suggestions ?
<&Squiggy> no prob
<&Squiggy> If it's for great justice
<&Squiggy> And the greatest masterpiece ever
<@junh1024-XD> lol
<@junh1024-XD> (I havent finished it yet, btw
<&Squiggy> DL is a bit slow tho
<&Squiggy> OMG
<&Squiggy> junh1024-XD
<&Squiggy> the snowfield rmx
* &Squiggy hands 1336 internets
<@junh1024-XD> yees
<@junh1024-XD> i asked you some months ago, "do you like the normal one better or the remix?"
<@junh1024-XD> and "what do you visualize when you listen to it?"
<@junh1024-XD> that's when i was working on it.
<&Squiggy> well
<&Squiggy> First off
<&Squiggy> TRhe circle thingy at like 0.30 doesn't fit

<&Squiggy> I'd have the sparkles continuously displayed
<&Squiggy> Like an actual snowfall
<&Squiggy> But yea
<&Squiggy> That oval-ish thing is really
<&Squiggy> Out of place
<@junh1024-XD> you'll see the reasons for my decisions if you watch it in full, butyes perhaps it's a bit out of place at the start
<&Squiggy> I do watch it in fullscreen
<&Squiggy> piano visuals are cool
<&Squiggy> Again oval thing
<&Squiggy> Now at 1.50 where the static sound kicks in
<&Squiggy> Can you add colors there?

<@junh1024-XD> i could, but
<&Squiggy> And from 2.10
<&Squiggy> The static hammering
<&Squiggy> Maybe have the whole visual screen flash
<&Squiggy> With 50% transparency or so
<&Squiggy> water drops are cool
<@junh1024-XD> :>
<&Squiggy> 2,45
<&Squiggy> ugh
<&Squiggy> ovals
<&Squiggy> That as a bassline visualizer is just wrong to me :/
<&Squiggy> It just doesn't merge with the other visuals
<&Squiggy> There's fading bars, round droplets
<@junh1024-XD> (it's the hihats/cymbals, not a bass visualiser)
<&Squiggy> Well it pops up when there's bass ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<@junh1024-XD> if you look closely, it's star-shaped, not round
<@junh1024-XD> when it rotates, I haven't finished that part yet
<&Squiggy> What I mean is
<&Squiggy> http://666kb.com/i/bv5f9t57tx7y64w9g.jpg
<&Squiggy> Oval one

<&Squiggy> In the middle
<@junh1024-XD> yep, that's the cymbals/hihats, not the bass.
-> -EvenPrime- http://www.mediafire.com/?iusk2hccqga89uq < this is what we're talking about if you just joined
<&Squiggy> That doesn't fit
<&Squiggy> In the video
<&Squiggy> By strengthening the 'bars' on the upper and lower side it might be possibleto just leave it out ┐(￣ー￣)┌
<@junh1024-XD> hm,
<&Squiggy> 3.15 can you make the slowflakes emerge from different points of the screen?
<@junh1024-XD> there;s only 1 emitter of snowflakes. so I would need 2 to make it happen or use a mirror, but eh
<@junh1024-XD> i like it this way
<&Squiggy> Also take not of the slight sound made by the bell on 3.29
<@junh1024-XD> oh, yeah
<&Squiggy> *note
<&Squiggy> 3.40 it rotates
<&Squiggy> I dunno but from then I visualize wind
<&Squiggy> field strips
<&Squiggy> Picture it as if you're elevated to a far place
<&Squiggy> With increasing speed
<&Squiggy> Especcially from 3.50
<&Squiggy> 3.57 !can! have half transparent slowfalkes (first impression)
<&Squiggy> Until 4.03
<&Squiggy> Again, flash it
<&Squiggy> 4.11 is too low in terms of the amount of visuals being presented
<&Squiggy> Like e.g. the bars again might mnakle an addition
<&Squiggy> Just barely visible
<@junh1024-XD> ah, yep, i was gonna do that
<&Squiggy> As background backup
<&Squiggy> 4.27 oval
<&Squiggy> 4,35 flash
<&Squiggy> it
<&Squiggy> So people notice the force the song brings with it
<&Squiggy> Just up to 4.40
<&Squiggy> If you bring in the piano thingies again from there it's awesome
<&Squiggy> 5.10 i'd lessen the amount of snowflakes being emitted
<&Squiggy> God here I am and give you all that stuff xD

<&Squiggy> A>dditional instrument comes in at 5.22 (triangle maybe)
<@junh1024-XD> yeah, i'm taking my time to write it in a paper notepad
<&Squiggy> The raindrop on 5.34 starts a littöle too late
<&Squiggy> But ends perfect

<&Squiggy> 5.49 stripes show up a little too late since you hear the pressure for a few secs already
<&Squiggy> Maybe have it fade in slowly if possible
<&Squiggy> 5.55 cool stuff
<@junh1024-XD> 5:34 < i'm having trouble with my random number generator. hard to fix
<&Squiggy> 6.21 lines bleind in
<&Squiggy> It's cool but makle them turn a bit slower if possible
<@junh1024-XD> that's the stripey oval thing, except enlarged
<&Squiggy> It distracts from the others
<&Squiggy> 6.500 maybe slowflakes
<&Squiggy> 6.50
<@junh1024-XD> i was thinkiong of the small circles from 1:12
<@junh1024-XD> & something else
<&Squiggy> 7.28 cool stuff
<&Squiggy> Totally approve
<@junh1024-XD> THat was one of the first sequences I did
<@junh1024-XD> after i got the sticks at the beginning sorted
<&Squiggy> 7.40 add something
<&Squiggy> Maybe a fade-to -3white boreder around everything
<&Squiggy> The difference between the current arrangement and the one before that is heaviery than displayed
<&Squiggy> 7.55 perfect
<&Squiggy> 8.20 changie is cool as well
<&Squiggy> *-i

<&Squiggy> Make the starts appear until 8.35 if possible
<@junh1024-XD> hm, yes,, a bug
<&Squiggy> Yea
<&Squiggy> Done that
<&Squiggy> Was an overall pleasure to watch
<&Squiggy> Well done
<@junh1024-XD> :>
<@junh1024-XD> , thanks
<&Squiggy> Whateveer changes you wanna made is ofc up to you
<&Squiggy> And
<&Squiggy> ye
<&Squiggy> a
<&Squiggy> that's it I guess
<@junh1024-XD> yeah, i think i'll do some of them
<&Squiggy> Just make sure to have it displayed real heavy from 7.40
<&Squiggy> That's my only real thing
<@junh1024-XD> ok
<&Squiggy> It's the climax of the song
<&Squiggy> And you may wanna have people go like WOA
<&Squiggy> Yep
<&Squiggy> It needs snow
<&Squiggy> Lots of
<@junh1024-XD> I was also thinking of umm, encoding it in 10-bit, aswel, since there's banding at 3:38
<&Squiggy> And fade to white
<&Squiggy> And piano
<&Squiggy> ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ｱﾊﾊ八八ﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉ ＼ / ＼/ ＼

<&Squiggy> http://666kb.com/i/bv5fx8afyejzuvyhg.gif
<&Squiggy> The marked one doesn't flicker
<&Squiggy> Just a note
<&Squiggy> Doesn't matter much to me but yea
<&Squiggy> Middle = focus
<&Squiggy> /blog end
<@junh1024-XD> yep, there aren't that many notes in te motif
<@junh1024-XD> also, the piano bit, notice the motion isn't that smooth
<&Squiggy> Can you have it displayed transparently?
<&Squiggy> If so, people may bnot even notice
<@junh1024-XD> maybe
<&Squiggy> On the climax part, that is
<@junh1024-XD> like invisible!
* @junh1024-XD hides
<&Squiggy> Like maybe 20% visibility
<&Squiggy> Just to riund it upo
<&Squiggy> *up
<&Squiggy> round
<&Squiggy> damn

<@junh1024-XD> http://i.imgur.com/fTbYN.png < for reference, here's what I called the sequences
<&Squiggy> Ugh
<&Squiggy> Looks like a shitload of effort
<@junh1024-XD> you could say that
<&Squiggy> junh1024-XD MAYBE it helps you a bit
<&Squiggy> Did you Audiosurf the song?
<@junh1024-XD> nope
<&Squiggy> Do you have audiosurf installed? ( ﾟ∀ﾟ)ｱﾊﾊ八八ﾉヽﾉヽﾉヽﾉ ＼ / ＼/ ＼
<@junh1024-XD> it's just moving blocks that are sometimes in sync with the music, from looks
<@junh1024-XD> no.
<&Squiggy> Dunno maybe you can catch a few ideas
<&Squiggy> Just my two cents
<@junh1024-XD> i've seen a few YT videos of it, and doesn't seem that in time
<&Squiggy> But don't worry if you don't have it ┓(ﾟヘﾟ;)┏ﾟ
<@junh1024-XD> ok, thanks for your feedback, Squiggy
[10:06:08] <&Squiggy> Was a pleasure

<@Issac> jun, you have quite a few conflicting elements in there, ie the particle snow effect and the water ripple
<@Issac> try and tie it to a specific idea, or styling you want to illustrate
<@Issac> you can keep it abstract, nothing wrong with that, just keeping it cohesive, ie instead of changing from horizontal to diagonal to vertical layouts
<@Issac> stay with one layout and see what that gives you
<@Issac> one major thought for you is to think of a feeling that song invokes in you and then get visuals whether abstract or literal and compose it into a sequence
<@Issac> lol, i'm a media designer
<@Issac> going back to do masters next year
<@Issac> haha xd
<@Issac> jun, just needs a bit more work xD
<@Issac> one thing you might want to look at is background and foreground too, cause there's background and foreground in sound as well :)



<&junh1024-XD> Issac did you watch all of it yesterday?
<@Issac> your vid
<@Issac> yah
<&junh1024-XD> k
<&junh1024-XD> the later parts 7:00+ better?
<@Issac> it lacks a bit of focus
<@Issac> ie, whats your theme?
<&junh1024-XD> none?
<&skullking123> ( Â¬â€¿Â¬)
<&junh1024-XD> its just visualizing music
<@Issac> even music visualisers have a theme of sorts
<@Issac> a lot of them out there play with the idea of fractales
<&junh1024-XD> constraints: greyscale, cinemascope
<@Issac> nono, what i mean is, what are you trying to get the line to represent?
<&junh1024-XD> multiple things
<@Issac> lol, like?
<&skullking123> this gonna be good
* &skullking123 grabs popcorn
<&junh1024-XD> the bulges represent notes of the synthesizer, the pulse/glow represents the 'clap' sound
<&junh1024-XD> the sizeing represents the bass drum
<@Issac> -.-||| erm....
<&junh1024-XD> i realized you can encode multiple things in a single element
<&skullking123> oh boi
<&skullking123> u sure took this visualization at face value
<&junh1024-XD> well how else do you look at it?
<@Issac> you want to add an idea behind your visuals rather than just literal representation, the idea should tie into the song's feeling, if you can understand that...
<&skullking123> u need a theme brah
<&skullking123> or everything will just seem random
<&junh1024-XD> the title of the song is "snowfield"
<&junh1024-XD> if that helps any
<&junh1024-XD> i didn't want to just put snow all over the place
<@Issac> example http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bdKMT1znJ0&feature=related

<@Issac> the simplest way i can put is imagine you have just the length of your song to visually communicate everything you feel as you hear it
<@Issac> the main thing is, everything you put in, every effect, has to relate to that theme, it's what will tied everything together
+waffo (~wut@Hououin.Kyouma) is now known as +wafuu
<&junh1024-XD> http://i.imgur.com/ahm4y.png < part of my inspiration for that sequence
<&junh1024-XD> the lights move left & right (Crystal Kay @ NHK Hall)
<@Issac> theme, theme, theme, how does that song make you feel?
<&junh1024-XD> trance/rave?
<@Issac> feeling, how do you feel inside? are you relaxed? traquil? inspired? hyper? dazed? aware?
<@Issac> if i say, i feel tranced, how would you think i'll feel?
<@Issac> you need to narrow it down a bit more
<&skullking123> internet folk dont have these so called fellings
<@Issac> pfft lol
<@Issac> it's just design 101 here
<@Issac> it's the first thing we teach new students at uni, or rather try to teach, a lot of them don't get it until their 3rd year
<@Issac> even then they say it's a bunch of bullshit
<@Issac> but hey, without it, their projects don't really have any direction
<&skullking123> ^truth
<&skullking123> it is a bunch of bullshit
<&junh1024-XD> it makes me feel like i want to visualize music
* &junh1024-XD hides
<&skullking123> a skilled person can fake it
<&skullking123> that's what she said
<&skullking123> :.
<&skullking123> :>
<@Issac> it is bullshit, it's a justification of the work that you've done
<@Issac> and whether ppl buy it or not
* &skullking123 throws romance books at junh1024-XD
<&skullking123> start there
<&skullking123> ( Â¬â€¿Â¬)
<&junh1024-XD> i was crap at english â”“(ï¾Ÿãƒ˜ï¾Ÿ;)â”ï¾Ÿ
<@Issac> if they do, then it means your work is worthwhile, if not, well you wasted a bit of time
<@Issac> jun, think this then, what do those sounds LOOK like?
<@Issac> if I hit a gong, and it made that boooonnnnnngggggg sound
<@Issac> whats the first image that comes to mind?
<&junh1024-XD> shaking zigzags
<@Issac> exactly, the shaking or the vibration visual right?
<@Issac> so in a sense, how would you visualise that song using the same pretext but with lines and monochrome colourspace?
<&junh1024-XD> well, there's a lot of different instruments and sections to the song
<@Issac> lol, jun try not to think of a song as "snare, drum, guitar, keyboard, piano, violin" etc instead try to extract some essence from the song :P
<&junh1024-XD> well, that's what i did the visuals loosely by - by instrument. it has some sort of consistency.
<@Issac> if you want to stick with the instrument division then you'll need to cement them in somehow, i noticed a lot of changes in the visuals and it started getting a bit random
<&junh1024-XD> sortove
<@Issac> just experiment a few times, at the end of the day, you have to like it first, before anyone else
<&junh1024-XD> i'll play with the opacity a bit when i have time
<&junh1024-XD> the layout thing umm, duno how to implement
<@Issac> i think layout is the biggest issue tho
<@Issac> it starts getting chaotic when things change between the versus
<&junh1024-XD> riight, well,
<@Issac> verses**
<&junh1024-XD> if i don't add new stuff when the verses stay the same, wouldn't it be boring to the audience
<&junh1024-XD> ?
<@Issac> god my grammar is horrible today
<&junh1024-XD> or is consistency better?
<@Issac> try subtle changes first
<@Issac> you need to be able to link between the changes
<&junh1024-XD> because if i kept the intro static & strictly consistent, then the audience would lose intrest - i found that out when i played it fron the start
<&junh1024-XD> and one person was like
<&junh1024-XD> "does this ever change"
<&junh1024-XD> so thats why the dots started appearing incrementally, instead of all at once
<@Issac> work on subtle changes not big cuts
<&junh1024-XD> k
<@Issac> but it has to have a meaning behind it
<@Issac> but it all comes down to that idea >.> lol
<&junh1024-XD> i was planning to make a
<&junh1024-XD> "the inspiration for clannad 3.6m" video
<&junh1024-XD> but that would require this to be finished first and
<&junh1024-XD> >chicken & egg problem
<&junh1024-XD> to show where i got ideas from, youknowyouknow?
<@Issac> lol, focus on one thing first :)
<&junh1024-XD> i've also got 2 other AFX projects, but actually include anime footage
<&junh1024-XD> and another 2 in my head
* &junh1024-XD hides
&[Zero-Raws] sets mode: +h [XDCC]Fumino
<@Issac> one thing to do is to watch a lot of youtube ones
<@Issac> take note of composition and the like
<&junh1024-XD> http://vimeo.com/5109641 < one from a few years ago
<&junh1024-XD> iirc, they made the music themselves

19/12/2011^

[22:35:37] <~Articuno> First question
[22:35:51] <~Articuno> why is the shape on the right slightly different to the one on the left? X33
[22:35:53] <~Articuno> in the intro
[22:35:58] <+Lighty> second question
[22:36:02] <+Lighty> DOES HE LOOK LIKE A BITSJ
[22:36:04] * +Lighty runs
[22:36:32] <+junh1024-XD> the traingle on the pole looks like a flag, which represents the triangle hit on the music
[22:36:40] <~Articuno> Right ok
[22:36:54] <+junh1024-XD> song is called snowfield, so i sstarted off with a skifield

[22:37:55] <~Articuno> Wow I love this, it's amazing....
[22:38:03] <+junh1024-XD> i was inspired by NFS6 & pkmnM9
[22:38:03] <+Magic_Mike> Ovo

[22:50:11] <~Articuno> jun, yes
[22:50:11] <~Articuno> <333333
[22:50:21] <~Articuno> It's flawless really ;v;
[22:52:51] <~Articuno> I really love the idea of shape-ifying music
[22:52:59] <~Articuno> I always like visualisations for that
