1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
Ruri,

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:03,568
I... I...

3
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:05,774
I can't go out with you!

4
00:00:05,773 --> 00:00:07,049
I like someone else!

5
00:00:10,454 --> 00:00:11,566
Onee-chan!

6
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:13,369
What is it, Tama-chan?

7
00:00:13,369 --> 00:00:16,246
Onii-chan hasn't been visiting us lately.

8
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,373
Y-Yeah, that's true!

9
00:00:20,293 --> 00:00:23,208
Did Onee-chan and him have a fight?

10
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:26,086
Well, who knows?

11
00:00:26,652 --> 00:00:29,251
Will he come celebrate Christmas with us?

12
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:46,734
I guess I lose!

13
00:00:46,734 --> 00:00:48,489
I ought to congratulate you!

14
00:00:48,489 --> 00:00:52,766
You are the only person who could admit such a thing.

15
00:00:52,766 --> 00:00:54,013
Kuroneko...

16
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:57,610
You no longer have the right to exist amongst the darkness.

17
00:00:57,610 --> 00:01:01,369
Take that holy sword of yours and go save the world.

18
00:01:01,369 --> 00:01:06,212
You, who shattered my first love, should have no difficulty doing so.

19
00:01:10,652 --> 00:01:12,052
Go on a date with Senpai

20
00:01:15,294 --> 00:01:16,694
Tell Senpai more about me

21
00:01:20,291 --> 00:01:21,212
Invite Senpai to my house

22
00:01:27,397 --> 00:01:31,137
This is what you wanted, right?

23
00:01:31,138 --> 00:01:32,653
Kuroneko...

24
00:01:33,219 --> 00:01:36,096
Yes, from the very beginning...

25
00:01:37,371 --> 00:01:39,500
This...

26
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:41,773
This was our fate...

27
00:01:42,099 --> 00:01:43,336
I knew that...

28
00:02:05,634 --> 00:02:10,429
