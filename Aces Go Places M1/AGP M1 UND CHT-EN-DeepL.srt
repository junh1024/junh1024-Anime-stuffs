
1
00:03:07,738 --> 00:03:09,103
Thank you.

2
00:03:12,076 --> 00:03:13,065
Grenade!

3
00:03:45,109 --> 00:03:46,098
pay one's respects by bowing with hands in front of one's chest

4
00:03:59,824 --> 00:04:04,284
I'm sorry. The elevator's broken. Bye-bye.

5
00:04:07,231 --> 00:04:08,220
Don't move.

6
00:04:17,241 --> 00:04:23,703
Over there. Come on, over there.

7
00:04:33,424 --> 00:04:34,413
What are you still doing?

8
00:04:35,393 --> 00:04:38,385
I'll tune your engine. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, 
no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

9
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:44,662
Now you've got a great car. It's faster than a rocket.

10
00:04:52,476 --> 00:04:53,534
Your father didn't ask me to take care of you when he died.

11
00:04:53,744 --> 00:04:54,802
I'd have thrown you overboard, you idiot.

12
00:04:54,845 --> 00:04:55,743
know

13
00:04:55,780 --> 00:04:56,712
What's next?

14
00:04:56,747 --> 00:04:57,736
The plane. What?

15
00:04:57,915 --> 00:04:59,348
The yacht. What?

16
00:04:59,717 --> 00:05:01,912
No, it's kite flying.

17
00:05:02,253 --> 00:05:03,242
Go on.

18
00:05:04,522 --> 00:05:05,580
Kite flying Kite flying

19
00:05:06,357 --> 00:05:07,449
Go on.

20
00:05:27,945 --> 00:05:28,934
pay one's respects by bowing with hands in front of one's chest

21
00:09:05,262 --> 00:09:06,729
Romano, it's so good to see you again.

22
00:09:06,931 --> 00:09:10,059
Manti, welcome back.

23
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:12,566
Mantis, have a good time in Hong Kong?

24
00:09:12,636 --> 00:09:14,695
No, the godfather's not happy about it.

25
00:09:14,738 --> 00:09:15,602
Me too.

26
00:09:15,639 --> 00:09:17,004
He's waiting to see you. You be careful.

27
00:09:17,174 --> 00:09:18,698
Thank you. Thank you.

28
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,141
The Godfather of Anthony

29
00:09:31,889 --> 00:09:33,413
Go play with your mommy, little cutie.

30
00:09:36,126 --> 00:09:37,593
Manti, my boy.

31
00:09:38,862 --> 00:09:40,625
I'm sorry, dear Godfather.

32
00:09:42,166 --> 00:09:44,430
You're sorry. What the hell are you doing?

33
00:09:45,169 --> 00:09:46,761
What the hell are you doing?

34
00:09:47,605 --> 00:09:48,833
But... this man...

35
00:09:49,073 --> 00:09:53,772
Every time you make a mistake, you always have an explanation.

36
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:58,070
Now tell me who did it.

37
00:09:58,882 --> 00:09:59,974
white glove

38
00:10:01,485 --> 00:10:05,285
It's him. There he is.

39
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:06,747
He's in Venice.

40
00:10:17,234 --> 00:10:19,293
I always trusted you, son.

41
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:22,097
I've always been faithful to you, too, Godfather.

42
00:10:22,439 --> 00:10:26,773
Anyway, go to Hong Kong and get the diamond back to me

43
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:28,734
Why me?

44
00:10:30,247 --> 00:10:33,444
Otherwise, you'll be a dead fish.

45
00:10:33,851 --> 00:10:36,149
You can use my connections in Hong Kong.

46
00:10:36,754 --> 00:10:41,214
I can lose the diamonds, but not the heart and face of an Italian.

47
00:10:41,558 --> 00:10:42,547
You know what?

48
00:10:42,593 --> 00:10:43,685
But I'm British.

49
00:10:44,094 --> 00:10:50,829
Idiot, you haven't figured out that the English are related to the 
Italians.

50
00:10:50,934 --> 00:10:51,923
How come I've never heard of it?

51
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,232
The diamond or your life.

52
00:11:16,293 --> 00:11:18,989
Morning, Commissioner. According to our information.

53
00:11:19,196 --> 00:11:20,185
slow

54
00:11:20,664 --> 00:11:23,428
You don't have to talk nonsense to foreigners

55
00:11:23,634 --> 00:11:26,660
It's okay to speak in person, Hana.

56
00:11:27,504 --> 00:11:31,235
A serious robbery took place recently in Tsim Sha Tsui Centre

57
00:11:31,608 --> 00:11:36,204
A valuable shipment of diamonds was taken and no one reported the robbery.

58
00:11:36,513 --> 00:11:38,640
Let's look at the information we have collected

59
00:11:47,991 --> 00:11:53,429
He's a local gangster, Szeto Buren, who collects stolen goods.

60
00:11:55,866 --> 00:11:59,734
This is the new kid on the international smuggling block.

61
00:12:00,037 --> 00:12:02,904
He's Italian. His name is Montisutto.

62
00:12:03,173 --> 00:12:07,837
Stuart had nothing to lose in this robbery.

63
00:12:08,846 --> 00:12:11,974
And this Italian guy didn't report it.

64
00:12:12,783 --> 00:12:18,119
The only clue left at the scene was a white glove.

65
00:12:18,422 --> 00:12:22,688
As for our further information, it's a blank.

66
00:12:24,128 --> 00:12:28,121
The source of the above information is an undercover agent from us.

67
00:12:28,532 --> 00:12:32,696
We can't release his name because he's in a special position.

68
00:12:33,103 --> 00:12:34,502
It's a marginalized person.

69
00:12:34,705 --> 00:12:37,640
Don't make any noise. Don't ruin the atmosphere here.

70
00:12:37,975 --> 00:12:42,674
This is the world's most famous thief. He's called the White Glove.

71
00:12:43,113 --> 00:12:45,047
Specialized robbery of diamond gold

72
00:12:45,415 --> 00:12:48,578
He has seven passports, eight names.

73
00:12:48,819 --> 00:12:52,380
Nine identities and two genders.

74
00:12:53,423 --> 00:12:55,550
He's here on a case.

75
00:12:55,926 --> 00:12:58,656
You could say it's our pleasure.

76
00:12:59,196 --> 00:13:02,859
It's our misfortune, too.

77
00:13:03,433 --> 00:13:07,870
So we have to find a way to get his nemesis to do it.

78
00:13:08,105 --> 00:13:09,094
The archrival

79
00:13:09,273 --> 00:13:12,299
That's right. He's got two nemeses.

80
00:13:12,776 --> 00:13:15,939
The first one is the Pink Panther, Petersler.

81
00:13:16,346 --> 00:13:18,405
Unfortunately, he's already gone to heaven.

82
00:13:19,016 --> 00:13:21,484
The second one is...

83
00:13:21,685 --> 00:13:22,674
Don't block the view.

84
00:13:23,287 --> 00:13:25,312
America's Bald Detective

85
00:13:25,756 --> 00:13:30,056
He's been demoted from a bureau chief to a toilet warden to catch a white 
glove.

86
00:13:30,294 --> 00:13:34,754
From black hair to bald while his boss ordered him

87
00:13:34,998 --> 00:13:37,626
No more white gloves in three months.

88
00:13:37,935 --> 00:13:41,803
He'll have to adopt early and go back to his hometown to eat his rice.

89
00:13:44,208 --> 00:13:47,541
So we decided to invite the bald detective to Hong Kong

90
00:13:47,811 --> 00:13:51,042
Because he's the most enthusiastic white glove catcher.

91
00:13:51,281 --> 00:13:57,015
And this year's most outstanding young man, Superintendent Ho Tung-sze.

92
00:13:57,287 --> 00:13:58,481
That man-child.

93
00:13:59,122 --> 00:14:03,286
We're sending her to help Detective Baldy on this case.

94
00:14:03,493 --> 00:14:05,791
Yeah, that's great.

95
00:14:11,802 --> 00:14:13,497
Brother, is there any fire?

96
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:17,868
It's a lady

97
00:14:19,509 --> 00:14:21,101
The lady must have fire all over her.

98
00:14:21,378 --> 00:14:22,470
But... you're too conservative.

99
00:14:24,982 --> 00:14:26,779
A conservative girl is a prude.

100
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,678
You want to see it?

101
00:14:30,888 --> 00:14:31,946
Yeah, you don't need to tell me that.

102
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,821
Don't blink.

103
00:14:35,692 --> 00:14:38,559
Which? Fire, fire, fire.

104
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:41,525
You piss me off, this gun will go off any minute.

105
00:14:41,965 --> 00:14:44,866
It's his fault. It's not my fault. We won't do it again.

106
00:14:46,670 --> 00:14:49,571
Let's go. It's all your fault.

107
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,638
Let's not talk about it. Let's go.

108
00:14:56,747 --> 00:14:59,215
What are you looking at? I've never seen a woman's thighs before.

109
00:14:59,883 --> 00:15:01,282
I'm just looking at your gunny sack.

110
00:15:01,718 --> 00:15:03,913
Officer Ho, you're here to pick up Detective Bald's plane.

111
00:15:04,321 --> 00:15:07,154
I don't have time to pick him up. I'm here for the next guy.

112
00:15:07,524 --> 00:15:09,492
There are so many people. How will you find them?

113
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:13,761
Don't worry, he'll show up as soon as I yell.

114
00:15:14,431 --> 00:15:15,830
The Edge

115
00:15:16,033 --> 00:15:17,500
It's not here.

116
00:15:17,668 --> 00:15:18,965
Don't run away.

117
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:21,496
I can't help it.

118
00:15:22,239 --> 00:15:23,228
You're still running.

119
00:15:46,897 --> 00:15:47,886
Don't run.

120
00:15:57,841 --> 00:15:58,899
Come down.

121
00:16:00,944 --> 00:16:04,675
There's no one there. You're still trying to beat me up.

122
00:16:05,849 --> 00:16:09,046
I'm just covering for you. What's the news?

123
00:16:09,686 --> 00:16:12,450
There are three. Two are real and one is fake.

124
00:16:14,157 --> 00:16:15,681
Well, let's tell you two real things.

125
00:16:17,027 --> 00:16:19,928
It's really the bald American detective coming to Hong Kong today

126
00:16:20,097 --> 00:16:21,860
Your superiors sent you to help him with his investigation.

127
00:16:22,299 --> 00:16:23,459
You know our top secret.

128
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:25,825
How else could I be an informant?

129
00:16:26,403 --> 00:16:27,392
And?

130
00:16:27,704 --> 00:16:30,969
And that's the day someone tried to rob the Chow Tai Fook gold shop

131
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,230
How did you know it was today?

132
00:16:32,609 --> 00:16:33,871
The day I chose for him.

133
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:36,568
Is this a good day?

134
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,939
It's because it's not a good day.

135
00:16:42,452 --> 00:16:43,441
It's fake.

136
00:16:44,154 --> 00:16:46,816
False is when your superiors say you won't pick up the plane at the airport.

137
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,785
Just let me come around here for a bit.

138
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:52,287
I'm so unlucky to meet a man-child like you.

139
00:16:57,134 --> 00:16:58,123
It's time.

140
00:16:58,168 --> 00:17:01,228
We should be here. We're not waiting. I'm going to check the case.

141
00:17:01,405 --> 00:17:02,394
What case?

142
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,634
It's none of your business. It's a big case anyway.

143
00:17:22,225 --> 00:17:23,715
Clouds against water Snow against wind

144
00:17:24,127 --> 00:17:25,890
Whiteboard vs. Red, Big Four.

145
00:17:26,096 --> 00:17:27,825
Young man, you're so unlucky.

146
00:17:28,065 --> 00:17:29,259
Self-touch is the best

147
00:17:30,333 --> 00:17:31,561
My name is Chan Pak Keung

148
00:17:32,269 --> 00:17:33,600
My name is Oui Keung.

149
00:17:34,704 --> 00:17:36,262
My name is a fake.

150
00:17:37,207 --> 00:17:38,572
Mine's fake too.

151
00:17:49,286 --> 00:17:53,017
Boss, someone's coming to rob us later.

152
00:17:53,557 --> 00:17:55,388
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

153
00:17:55,492 --> 00:18:02,364
Don't move. What are you doing? Climbing down.

154
00:18:05,068 --> 00:18:06,865
Get in the corner. Come on.

155
00:18:08,605 --> 00:18:10,300
Fill this bag up. Come on.

156
00:18:14,344 --> 00:18:18,007
Attention all units, Chow Tai Fook gold shop alarm has been sounded.

157
00:18:18,248 --> 00:18:19,977
Go see what's going on.

158
00:18:21,384 --> 00:18:22,442
Where is Chow Tai Fook Gold Shop

159
00:18:22,686 --> 00:18:23,675
One turn and we're there.

160
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,709
Go see.

161
00:18:25,956 --> 00:18:27,184
Brother, the bag is full.

162
00:18:27,357 --> 00:18:29,222
Okay, get out and get a car. Don't move.

163
00:18:35,732 --> 00:18:36,721
Don't move.

164
00:18:37,901 --> 00:18:39,835
Don't move. Sit back down or you'll break your head.

165
00:18:43,006 --> 00:18:43,995
Don't move.

166
00:18:44,574 --> 00:18:45,563
Brother, the car is ready.

167
00:18:45,742 --> 00:18:46,731
Don't move!

168
00:18:51,681 --> 00:18:52,670
Drive.

169
00:19:03,527 --> 00:19:05,552
Get out of the car. The police are commandeering your car.

170
00:19:12,135 --> 00:19:13,295
Key!

171
00:19:13,503 --> 00:19:14,868
Here.

172
00:19:18,542 --> 00:19:21,010
Come on, hurry up, baldy.

173
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:23,375
It's hard to go slow, but it's too easy to go fast.

174
00:19:24,548 --> 00:19:25,537
Hurry up!

175
00:19:40,163 --> 00:19:44,964
You want to die? How do you drive? Drive carefully. Come on.

176
00:19:51,007 --> 00:19:53,771
You old man, you want us dead.

177
00:19:53,877 --> 00:19:55,401
Accident. Sorry.

178
00:19:55,545 --> 00:19:59,709
Come on, drive! Come on!

179
00:20:03,286 --> 00:20:05,686
Bastard! You hit and run!

180
00:20:54,638 --> 00:20:56,469
Get out of the car, police.

181
00:20:58,241 --> 00:21:00,732
One of our own. I was a police officer in the States.

182
00:21:01,244 --> 00:21:03,439
You're a police officer. You're a rustic.

183
00:21:03,613 --> 00:21:04,602
Smuggled in from the mainland

184
00:21:04,781 --> 00:21:05,770
not

185
00:21:06,916 --> 00:21:09,783
They're all over the street. They have all the stuff they need in the toy 
stores.

186
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:16,858
I caught a bunch of thieves for you. Take a look.

187
00:21:31,508 --> 00:21:32,497
Come in.

188
00:21:38,114 --> 00:21:41,641
Get out of the way. Sit down.

189
00:21:49,025 --> 00:21:50,424
You four, who's the boss?

190
00:21:50,727 --> 00:21:52,024
He's the boss.

191
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,527
Buffalo, monkey, confession.

192
00:21:55,565 --> 00:21:56,463
Get up.

193
00:21:56,499 --> 00:21:57,659
Baldy, come with me.

194
00:22:00,437 --> 00:22:01,426
Get out of the way.

195
00:22:03,006 --> 00:22:03,995
sit

196
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,439
Okay, thanks.

197
00:22:09,379 --> 00:22:10,368
That way.

198
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,279
Okay, okay, okay.

199
00:22:18,188 --> 00:22:19,780
You won't be able to kick it.

200
00:22:20,323 --> 00:22:22,120
Baldy, are you familiar with the laws here?

201
00:22:22,192 --> 00:22:25,457
I'm not familiar with the laws here. I know American law by heart.

202
00:22:26,329 --> 00:22:28,593
How dare you rob in here? When did you get here?

203
00:22:29,099 --> 00:22:30,088
Just arrived.

204
00:22:30,567 --> 00:22:31,829
How did you smuggle yourself in?

205
00:22:32,068 --> 00:22:33,968
I came by plane.

206
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:35,159
Do you have any relatives or friends?

207
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,171
I don't have any relatives, and I don't have any friends that I know.

208
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:38,601
There's one who knows me.

209
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:39,505
Who

210
00:22:39,542 --> 00:22:40,531
Hong Kong Governor

211
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:45,079
He called me and asked me to come.

212
00:22:46,049 --> 00:22:47,607
How dare you be a smartass?

213
00:22:48,385 --> 00:22:50,717
You can't answer my fucking question if I ask you now.

214
00:22:51,254 --> 00:22:52,243
If you want to answer

215
00:22:52,389 --> 00:22:54,482
It can be used as testimony in court in the future, right?

216
00:22:58,261 --> 00:22:59,250
What's the name?

217
00:22:59,362 --> 00:23:01,455
My name is AlbertAu.

218
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:06,268
English names are also popular on the mainland, where they're from.

219
00:23:06,469 --> 00:23:07,458
Taipei

220
00:23:07,504 --> 00:23:08,493
Not married.

221
00:23:08,538 --> 00:23:09,903
No. And you?

222
00:23:10,173 --> 00:23:12,505
What's it to you, gender?

223
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:14,275
I have a moustache.

224
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,500
So what if you have a moustache?

225
00:23:15,545 --> 00:23:16,773
A beard is a man.

226
00:23:17,213 --> 00:23:20,842
I'm not like you. I don't have the brains of a man or the body of a woman.

227
00:23:21,117 --> 00:23:24,575
What gender are you, male or female?

228
00:23:26,823 --> 00:23:27,812
You want to have an affair?

229
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:30,790
I don't hit you. You hit me.

230
00:23:31,961 --> 00:23:32,950
Don't move.

231
00:23:33,797 --> 00:23:35,890
That's great. That's great. That's fantastic.

232
00:23:38,168 --> 00:23:41,001
The bald detective really lives up to his name.

233
00:23:41,171 --> 00:23:43,435
There, this man-child is the real deal.

234
00:23:44,307 --> 00:23:48,243
Superintendent Ho is really something. He's working more efficiently.

235
00:23:48,445 --> 00:23:50,310
But... it's just a little slow.

236
00:23:51,147 --> 00:23:55,777
I've arranged for Superintendent Ho to help you with this case.

237
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:57,681
She... Forget it.

238
00:23:58,054 --> 00:24:03,321
To protect your identity, I arranged for you to be a married couple.

239
00:24:03,493 --> 00:24:04,983
What? He's my husband.

240
00:24:05,595 --> 00:24:08,928
He's not worthy of being my husband. Look at his dead face.

241
00:24:09,732 --> 00:24:12,701
That's what I said, fatty. Have you booked the hotel yet?

242
00:24:12,735 --> 00:24:13,724
I've ordered it.

243
00:24:13,770 --> 00:24:17,763
Put her in the room next to mine. Get her a room too. I want to be 
married to her.

244
00:24:17,941 --> 00:24:18,930
You're beautiful.

245
00:24:19,943 --> 00:24:21,740
What about Superintendent Ho? Are you afraid of him?

246
00:24:21,911 --> 00:24:25,608
What am I afraid of? I'm not used to hotels. Come and stay at my place if 
you dare.

247
00:24:25,882 --> 00:24:26,871
Go to your house.

248
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:27,780
You're afraid.

249
00:24:27,817 --> 00:24:31,253
I'm afraid. I'm afraid she'll eat me.

250
00:24:35,058 --> 00:24:37,458
Don't treat me like a woman, baldy.

251
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,694
The whole police department treats me like a man.

252
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,957
We're just pretending to be husband and wife. Don't take it seriously.

253
00:24:46,169 --> 00:24:50,936
What are you afraid of? It's not like we haven't seen it before. Come on 
out.

254
00:24:55,879 --> 00:24:58,006
According to the information my informant gave me.

255
00:24:58,281 --> 00:25:02,115
This is the kid who took the diamonds. His name is King Kong.

256
00:25:02,252 --> 00:25:04,482
Nicknamed the Flying Thief.

257
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,021
He also has a partner called Fountain of Mouth.

258
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:10,191
He's the Fountain of Mouth. He's a self-proclaimed son-of-a-bitch.

259
00:25:10,593 --> 00:25:12,686
All over the woman's phone

260
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,793
They haven't been seen since they did the case.

261
00:25:16,199 --> 00:25:18,326
King Kong lives on the fifth floor across the street.

262
00:25:43,259 --> 00:25:45,159
King Kong, I'm a fountain of water.

263
00:25:45,194 --> 00:25:45,819
Calling my name again.

264
00:25:45,862 --> 00:25:48,797
No, red cats are called black cats, over.

265
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:50,497
The black cat heard you. Tell me.

266
00:25:51,067 --> 00:25:53,763
Report the black cat. I'm gonna put the diamond in my collection. - No.

267
00:25:53,803 --> 00:25:54,633
Also mentions Diamond

268
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:57,970
It's peanuts. I'm going to tell you where I collected the bag of peanuts.

269
00:25:59,008 --> 00:26:01,306
You can't tell me. I'll talk in my sleep.

270
00:26:01,511 --> 00:26:05,971
I know. If I don't tell you this time, something will happen.

271
00:26:06,149 --> 00:26:07,138
Why?

272
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,675
It's because I've recently picked up the sister of a maniac.

273
00:26:10,453 --> 00:26:12,648
You dare to pick up Madman's sister? This time you're dead.

274
00:26:12,956 --> 00:26:15,220
That's why I'm telling you. Let's find a restaurant and talk.

275
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:16,449
All right, that one.

276
00:26:16,793 --> 00:26:18,385
No, I can't tell you.

277
00:26:19,028 --> 00:26:21,292
If you don't tell me, how do I know which one?

278
00:26:25,501 --> 00:26:27,662
Okay, I'll tell you in a whisper, you listen carefully.

279
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:31,403
I can't hear you. Speak up.

280
00:26:31,641 --> 00:26:35,975
That's stupid. Seventh Heaven Western Restaurant. Did you hear that?

281
00:26:43,386 --> 00:26:45,684
Go to the Seventh Heaven Western Restaurant. The Black Cat is waiting for 
you.

282
00:26:47,123 --> 00:26:50,752
You've picked up Madman's girl. Give the diamond to Black Cat.

283
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:53,324
Remember, it's not a diamond. It's a peanut.

284
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,633
It's him.

285
00:27:14,283 --> 00:27:16,342
It's the white glove. Go after him.

286
00:27:19,088 --> 00:27:20,077
vajra

287
00:27:20,156 --> 00:27:21,145
tomboy

288
00:27:23,059 --> 00:27:24,287
Don't go, King Kong.

289
00:27:24,761 --> 00:27:27,127
Not that one. This one.

290
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:51,680
You want me dead.

291
00:28:28,124 --> 00:28:29,318
You can't do that.

292
00:28:29,759 --> 00:28:30,748
You bastard!

293
00:28:30,793 --> 00:28:31,555
pay one's respects by bowing with hands in front of one's chest

294
00:28:31,594 --> 00:28:37,191
Don't fucking run. I'm gonna get you.

295
00:28:44,574 --> 00:28:46,599
Don't go, King Kong.

296
00:29:02,692 --> 00:29:03,920
Stop the car. Stop the car.

297
00:29:09,031 --> 00:29:11,295
Man-child. Bye-bye.

298
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,096
pay one's respects by bowing with hands in front of one's chest

299
00:29:16,873 --> 00:29:18,033
parking

300
00:29:36,826 --> 00:29:37,815
Sir, a few people, please.

301
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,122
I'll do it myself.

302
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:41,752
The red cat is here.

303
00:29:47,470 --> 00:29:49,335
The bag of diamonds. No, it's peanuts.

304
00:29:49,539 --> 00:29:51,939
The bag of peanuts. I hid it safely.

305
00:29:52,208 --> 00:29:55,700
I've carved this secret into two separate women.

306
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:59,007
Go ahead. Why are you so nervous?

307
00:29:59,315 --> 00:30:02,807
It's the one in the movies where they tell secrets to other people.

308
00:30:03,052 --> 00:30:04,781
They must have killed him before he got halfway through.

309
00:30:05,822 --> 00:30:07,881
Don't be afraid. The one you're listening to won't die.

310
00:30:09,425 --> 00:30:10,414
Come on.

311
00:30:11,394 --> 00:30:13,760
The bag of diamonds.

312
00:30:15,064 --> 00:30:16,053
What's up?

313
00:30:16,165 --> 00:30:17,894
I got shot. Didn't you see that?

314
00:30:20,403 --> 00:30:23,770
They're just opening champagne. Say it.

315
00:30:26,042 --> 00:30:29,034
I don't think it's safe here. Go to the toilet.

316
00:30:33,883 --> 00:30:35,043
All right, you can talk now.

317
00:30:35,184 --> 00:30:36,173
Let's talk about it.

318
00:30:36,686 --> 00:30:37,675
I put the bag of diamonds

319
00:30:38,287 --> 00:30:41,222
No, I hid the peanuts in Kowloon.

320
00:30:41,457 --> 00:30:42,651
Wait, I can't talk.

321
00:30:42,758 --> 00:30:43,782
What's going on?

322
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,828
Don't worry, you can talk all you want. I'm deaf. I can't hear anything.

323
00:30:49,031 --> 00:30:51,329
He's a mute. He didn't say anything. Let's go.

324
00:30:57,073 --> 00:30:58,062
What's up?

325
00:30:58,107 --> 00:30:59,132
madman

326
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,138
I'm gonna die this time.

327
00:31:02,216 --> 00:31:03,204
Let's slip out the back door.

328
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:14,015
Come in.

329
00:31:18,967 --> 00:31:20,160
There's no one here. Go ahead and talk.

330
00:31:20,401 --> 00:31:24,928
The bag of peanuts is hidden in Wait a minute, did you notice that this 
elevator is very narrow?

331
00:31:28,876 --> 00:31:32,936
Watch your right. Sorry. Excuse me.

332
00:31:33,748 --> 00:31:36,341
Could you move over, please?

333
00:31:44,391 --> 00:31:45,652
Don't be afraid. It's a foreign devil.

334
00:31:45,926 --> 00:31:47,222
You're the one who's a ghost

335
00:31:47,427 --> 00:31:48,415
Yeah.

336
00:31:50,764 --> 00:31:53,732
It's okay, we just have to say that the Shaolin monk shaved his head and 
became a monk.

337
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,457
Burning Red Lotus Temple. Mystery on the line.

338
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:56,657
What is it?

339
00:31:56,803 --> 00:31:58,770
It means repeating each word more than once.

340
00:31:58,939 --> 00:31:59,927
Then you should speak up.

341
00:32:00,807 --> 00:32:03,570
That packet of peanuts is hidden in Dragon 9

342
00:32:04,177 --> 00:32:05,165
What did you say?

343
00:32:05,545 --> 00:32:07,978
The bag of peanuts is hidden in Kowloon.

344
00:32:10,951 --> 00:32:13,043
Please, let's open it for a second.

345
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,310
Get out of the way.

346
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:20,982
Even the kids can talk about it. What's the mystery?

347
00:32:22,862 --> 00:32:23,850
There's no one here.

348
00:32:26,298 --> 00:32:28,094
Wait. Let's get out.

349
00:32:28,534 --> 00:32:29,522
That way.

350
00:32:59,632 --> 00:33:08,471
Black cat, I'm here. I'm afraid of heights. My arms and legs are weak now.

351
00:33:08,807 --> 00:33:12,139
But you remember, Rose.

352
00:33:12,343 --> 00:33:17,336
What rose? Let's not talk about that. What are you doing now?

353
00:33:17,515 --> 00:33:20,244
What can I do? Can't you see what I'm doing?

354
00:33:20,285 --> 00:33:24,448
I'm not in the middle of anything, but I'm really sorry.

355
00:33:24,556 --> 00:33:25,647
What's wrong with me?

356
00:33:25,857 --> 00:33:30,088
I'm sorry that you can't eat the peanuts

357
00:33:30,261 --> 00:33:32,728
It's okay, Red Cat. You remember.

358
00:33:32,897 --> 00:33:36,992
No matter what, we'll always be best buddies.

359
00:33:37,135 --> 00:33:38,761
Always.

360
00:34:08,932 --> 00:34:09,920
I got the white glove.

361
00:34:12,169 --> 00:34:13,157
This is not a white glove.

362
00:34:13,403 --> 00:34:15,267
The white gloves are the ones with the hooked nose and blue eyes, Ahjumma.

363
00:34:15,572 --> 00:34:18,438
I guarantee he's the thief who robbed the diamond, Uncle.

364
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:19,899
He doesn't look like a thief.

365
00:34:19,943 --> 00:34:20,806
unlike

366
00:34:20,844 --> 00:34:23,073
There's a way. Let me try it and he'll know.

367
00:34:23,479 --> 00:34:24,706
How do I try?

368
00:34:24,947 --> 00:34:28,438
Just use my science certificate from Scotland Yard in the States.

369
00:34:29,218 --> 00:34:30,650
But you want to work with me.

370
00:34:35,758 --> 00:34:36,746
Please sit down.

371
00:34:38,995 --> 00:34:40,291
No need to check. Sit down. Sit down.

372
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:44,096
I won't answer any questions until my lawyer gets here.

373
00:34:44,433 --> 00:34:46,127
Let's play an IQ game.

374
00:34:46,402 --> 00:34:47,891
I'll wait until my lawyer gets here.

375
00:34:48,104 --> 00:34:49,798
Do you know who I am?

376
00:34:49,972 --> 00:34:50,960
I haven't asked for advice yet.

377
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:57,501
I'm the bald Chinese detective who came in first place in Scotland Yard.

378
00:34:57,647 --> 00:34:59,409
You've heard of me.

379
00:34:59,649 --> 00:35:00,637
Heard of it. Heard of it.

380
00:35:00,817 --> 00:35:01,805
We work together

381
00:35:01,984 --> 00:35:03,075
I'll wait until my lawyer gets here.

382
00:35:03,285 --> 00:35:04,273
son of a bitch

383
00:35:04,319 --> 00:35:05,307
Give me your hand.

384
00:35:05,453 --> 00:35:06,441
It's not that I don't give you face.

385
00:35:08,423 --> 00:35:09,753
What? It's not in there yet.

386
00:35:10,959 --> 00:35:11,947
Don't mess around

387
00:35:11,993 --> 00:35:12,981
Bring it.

388
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:17,254
Did you hear that?

389
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:19,224
Detective, let's play the game.

390
00:35:19,634 --> 00:35:22,864
Okay, I'll play a reaction game with you.

391
00:35:23,205 --> 00:35:25,570
You take your hand out and each of you hit it.

392
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:27,673
Whoever can hit the other guy wins.

393
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,398
So who's gonna do it first?

394
00:35:29,444 --> 00:35:31,502
Of course it's me. Show me your hands.

395
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:39,908
That way.

396
00:35:44,692 --> 00:35:45,680
It's my turn, right?

397
00:35:45,860 --> 00:35:46,848
Can we not play?

398
00:35:47,061 --> 00:35:48,049
Get your hands out.

399
00:35:51,565 --> 00:35:52,622
Which hand is it?

400
00:35:53,634 --> 00:35:54,622
This one.

401
00:35:54,668 --> 00:35:55,656
Decision made.

402
00:35:57,004 --> 00:35:57,992
Decision made.

403
00:35:58,172 --> 00:35:59,160
My lawyer's here.

404
00:36:07,381 --> 00:36:08,369
Now it's my turn.

405
00:36:12,486 --> 00:36:13,577
You son of a bitch.

406
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:16,813
Where's my gun?

407
00:36:17,191 --> 00:36:18,179
Here.

408
00:36:21,462 --> 00:36:22,826
It's not mine.

409
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:24,289
She has yours.

410
00:36:28,134 --> 00:36:29,157
Have you had enough?

411
00:36:29,802 --> 00:36:33,464
There's another one. This is the one I grew up with. I'm gonna win.

412
00:36:33,973 --> 00:36:34,961
What if we don't win?

413
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:36,299
Let you go.

414
00:36:37,844 --> 00:36:39,071
Come here. Come here.

415
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,379
It's simple. Hold the ear in your right hand.

416
00:36:42,582 --> 00:36:45,141
Press your left hand to the ground and turn five times.

417
00:36:45,451 --> 00:36:48,783
Then go get the poker cards. You win if you get them.

418
00:36:49,122 --> 00:36:51,055
If you don't get it, you'll have to work with me.

419
00:36:51,391 --> 00:36:53,255
No problem. You show me.

420
00:36:53,459 --> 00:36:57,121
It's easy. It's like a child singing. Hold your ear and press down.

421
00:36:57,463 --> 00:37:03,560
Heads down, butts up. First lap of the Chrysanthemum Garden, second lap 
of the Dragon Boat.

422
00:37:03,769 --> 00:37:07,226
My back is sore on the third lap, and I'm out of breath on the fourth.

423
00:37:07,439 --> 00:37:10,566
The fifth circle is weak. Do you get it?

424
00:37:11,109 --> 00:37:12,097
Got it. Come on.

425
00:37:12,477 --> 00:37:13,465
Come on.

426
00:37:14,579 --> 00:37:15,567
Which side should I turn first?

427
00:37:15,614 --> 00:37:18,980
Stupid. Just follow me around. See?

428
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,439
It's so slow.

429
00:37:20,552 --> 00:37:24,248
It's okay if it's fast. I'm moving you. Is it fast?

430
00:37:24,456 --> 00:37:25,581
How can you make five turns so fast?

431
00:37:25,791 --> 00:37:31,228
Sure, I'm on my third, fourth, fifth, right?

432
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:32,851
I see. Come on.

433
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,053
Come on. Come on.

434
00:37:34,333 --> 00:37:38,428
First lap Chrysanthemum Garden Second lap Dragon Boat Watch

435
00:37:38,737 --> 00:37:43,230
My back is sore on the third lap, and I'm out of breath on the fourth.

436
00:37:43,541 --> 00:37:48,204
Fifth lap, legs are weak. Sixth lap, gold stars.

437
00:37:48,479 --> 00:37:49,467
Thank you for your hard work.

438
00:37:53,684 --> 00:37:54,672
pay one's respects by bowing with hands in front of one's chest

439
00:37:56,087 --> 00:37:59,749
I used to be able to go five rounds without losing my face.

440
00:37:59,957 --> 00:38:02,288
He's gone. What for?

441
00:38:03,194 --> 00:38:04,558
I'm gonna take a break.

442
00:38:40,063 --> 00:38:42,997
I'm a white glove. I'm gonna kill you.

443
00:38:46,469 --> 00:38:47,799
If you want to kill me, you have to wait a while

444
00:38:48,538 --> 00:38:49,526
Why?

445
00:38:49,572 --> 00:38:51,061
Because someone rang the doorbell, idiot.

446
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,789
Jao, boss.

447
00:39:12,394 --> 00:39:13,382
Come on.

448
00:39:14,997 --> 00:39:17,863
Kid, don't go. I'll go get help.

449
00:39:18,067 --> 00:39:19,226
call for help

450
00:39:25,908 --> 00:39:31,573
It's him. It's him. Go after him.

451
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:01,939
Call the Superintendent. He's got the door up.

452
00:40:02,844 --> 00:40:04,777
Okay, second walk.

453
00:40:04,979 --> 00:40:05,967
know

454
00:40:17,825 --> 00:40:20,691
Police station? Someone hit my door.

455
00:40:21,095 --> 00:40:24,325
You got the wrong number. I'm a white glove.

456
00:40:24,631 --> 00:40:26,461
I have a gift for you.

457
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,362
Hurry up and check the door.

458
00:40:34,975 --> 00:40:35,963
What is this thing?

459
00:41:18,551 --> 00:41:21,485
This is exactly the same as a diamond robbery.

460
00:41:59,524 --> 00:42:02,117
Chan Pak Keung, it's your turn.

461
00:42:55,212 --> 00:42:57,406
Don't be afraid. I'm here.

462
00:42:58,715 --> 00:42:59,806
I can't get it out.

463
00:42:59,983 --> 00:43:00,971
Hold it out straight.

464
00:43:01,418 --> 00:43:02,406
Yes.

465
00:43:04,820 --> 00:43:06,309
Slotted. Look behind you.

466
00:43:12,828 --> 00:43:15,022
If it wasn't for me, you'd be dead.

467
00:43:15,231 --> 00:43:16,663
Thank you for saving my life.

468
00:43:16,899 --> 00:43:17,922
How will you repay me?

469
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:19,598
We'll talk when my lawyer gets here.

470
00:43:23,806 --> 00:43:26,899
Detective, you're gonna have to get me up here first.

471
00:43:27,109 --> 00:43:29,269
I'm working on the diamond case.

472
00:43:29,512 --> 00:43:30,500
I didn't do it.

473
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,203
Then I've come to the wrong person.

474
00:43:33,582 --> 00:43:36,812
I admit it. I admit it. I did it.

475
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:38,879
What about the bag of diamonds?

476
00:43:39,121 --> 00:43:40,109
I don't know.

477
00:43:40,323 --> 00:43:42,847
If you don't tell me, my hands will get weak.

478
00:43:43,092 --> 00:43:44,786
Don't get soft. I told you.

479
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:46,856
The bag of diamonds is over there.

480
00:43:47,062 --> 00:43:48,050
The red cat is hiding.

481
00:43:48,263 --> 00:43:50,230
Where's Red Cat? He's dead.

482
00:43:50,565 --> 00:43:51,861
Again, lie to me.

483
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:54,432
All right, I promise to help you find the bag of diamonds.

484
00:43:54,703 --> 00:43:59,139
And you're gonna help me catch the white glove after I get the diamond 
back.

485
00:43:59,307 --> 00:44:01,171
Okay, but you have to promise me one thing.

486
00:44:01,276 --> 00:44:02,367
What's up?

487
00:44:02,577 --> 00:44:03,838
You can't sue me afterwards.

488
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:05,672
I promise you won't be guilty.

489
00:44:05,980 --> 00:44:07,071
What's your guarantee?

490
00:44:07,349 --> 00:44:08,679
I swear.

491
00:44:16,725 --> 00:44:17,713
The bombs are ready.

492
00:44:17,926 --> 00:44:18,914
We're ready.

493
00:44:19,094 --> 00:44:20,082
Take it up.

494
00:44:20,595 --> 00:44:21,583
Where's the wiretap?

495
00:44:21,629 --> 00:44:22,652
Installed above

496
00:44:22,864 --> 00:44:23,887
Who are you sending up?

497
00:44:24,232 --> 00:44:25,220
Loud Public

498
00:44:25,499 --> 00:44:26,897
He even makes a noise when he breathes.

499
00:44:27,334 --> 00:44:30,302
Don't worry, he won't make a sound this time.

500
00:44:33,841 --> 00:44:36,001
There's no way I'm staying in this place for another minute.

501
00:44:36,377 --> 00:44:38,503
How do you think we're going to live in a dull place?

502
00:44:38,746 --> 00:44:40,178
Eat up before you curse.

503
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:42,439
Eat. Look what these steaks look like.

504
00:44:42,783 --> 00:44:45,046
Lack of color and flavor.

505
00:44:45,252 --> 00:44:46,377
You son of a bitch.

506
00:44:46,453 --> 00:44:48,682
And you, bald guy, uncultured and disgusting.

507
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:50,617
And he wants me to share a room with him.

508
00:44:53,794 --> 00:44:58,457
And the air here is filthy, lacking in oxygen, it's suffocating.

509
00:45:05,104 --> 00:45:07,367
Look, he doesn't even make a sound.

510
00:45:08,141 --> 00:45:09,129
What about the bomb?

511
00:45:09,342 --> 00:45:10,467
I've already taken it up.

512
00:45:12,278 --> 00:45:14,108
Even the doorbell is so hard to hear

513
00:45:15,314 --> 00:45:16,302
What's up?

514
00:45:16,582 --> 00:45:17,570
Give me shoes.

515
00:45:17,617 --> 00:45:19,413
It must be my sister's. Put it down.

516
00:45:19,585 --> 00:45:21,950
Put it down. Okay.

517
00:45:24,791 --> 00:45:28,055
I can't stand it here anymore. I'm going home.

518
00:45:28,327 --> 00:45:30,590
If you want to work with me, come to my house

519
00:45:37,937 --> 00:45:38,925
Hello.

520
00:45:39,238 --> 00:45:40,295
Hello.

521
00:45:40,506 --> 00:45:41,597
I live here.

522
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:43,598
Me too.

523
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,600
Sister, you're back.

524
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:50,780
Don't you look at him. He's a pornographer. Get in.

525
00:46:00,392 --> 00:46:03,155
Sister, who are these two people?

526
00:46:03,662 --> 00:46:06,721
I'll introduce you to this one. You don't need to know this one.

527
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:09,465
This is useless even if you know it. Sit down.

528
00:46:13,004 --> 00:46:13,992
Have a seat.

529
00:46:15,474 --> 00:46:16,462
Didn't you say you were going back?

530
00:46:16,541 --> 00:46:17,939
Yeah, let's go. Let's go.

531
00:46:18,143 --> 00:46:20,007
It's okay. Sit down for a while and then go back.

532
00:46:26,383 --> 00:46:28,509
Sis, Japan is really fun.

533
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:30,575
Have you ever been to Japan?

534
00:46:31,155 --> 00:46:32,143
I've been there.

535
00:46:32,356 --> 00:46:33,344
do business

536
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:35,218
No, a thief.

537
00:46:36,827 --> 00:46:40,523
Shh. Didn't you see that? The kid saw your sister.

538
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:45,067
It's like he's been possessed. Now he's forgotten his father's name.

539
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:46,659
What's your father's last name?

540
00:46:46,937 --> 00:46:48,130
I don't know.

541
00:46:48,305 --> 00:46:49,396
Did you rob the diamond?

542
00:46:49,640 --> 00:46:51,072
It was me who grabbed it.

543
00:46:51,275 --> 00:46:52,434
Where is it hidden?

544
00:46:52,676 --> 00:46:54,609
It's the Red Cat's hideout.

545
00:46:54,678 --> 00:46:55,666
How can I find it?

546
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:59,571
He carved the secret into two girls.

547
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,374
How do I find those two girls?

548
00:47:01,652 --> 00:47:06,281
With you, I don't have to go looking for those two girls anymore, you 
bastard.

549
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:10,083
Baldy, did you hear that?

550
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,392
I told you this kid stole these diamonds.

551
00:47:13,630 --> 00:47:14,755
Did you lie to me?

552
00:47:15,164 --> 00:47:16,152
How could I lie to you?

553
00:47:16,499 --> 00:47:19,831
I'd rather lie to that bald guy and that man-child than to you.

554
00:47:20,537 --> 00:47:21,798
Why are you holding my hand?

555
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:23,733
We're all men. What does it matter?

556
00:47:24,974 --> 00:47:28,568
You heard him. He's the only one who knows where the diamonds are.

557
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:32,640
I'm ordering you now, before he finds the diamond.

558
00:47:32,815 --> 00:47:35,044
You have to keep him safe and sound.

559
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:36,950
Chang has taken the bombs up.

560
00:47:37,053 --> 00:47:38,485
What? Where's Chang?

561
00:47:38,655 --> 00:47:39,643
(located) at

562
00:47:39,689 --> 00:47:41,280
Come on, get up there and get the bomb back.

563
00:47:42,292 --> 00:47:43,724
No, we're out of time.

564
00:47:43,860 --> 00:47:44,848
Why?

565
00:47:44,894 --> 00:47:46,383
Enough time to go up, not enough time to come down.

566
00:47:46,595 --> 00:47:50,553
I don't care. We can't blow him up no matter what.

567
00:47:51,767 --> 00:47:53,393
You're not leaving yet.

568
00:47:54,870 --> 00:47:56,894
I'll go. Look.

569
00:47:59,608 --> 00:48:00,835
The air is better here.

570
00:48:01,243 --> 00:48:02,504
The bald guy's head is a bit more shiny

571
00:48:03,011 --> 00:48:04,705
And these steaks are better.

572
00:48:05,213 --> 00:48:06,611
But your sister is a little mean.

573
00:48:06,949 --> 00:48:07,937
What did you say?

574
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:09,745
A little bit. A little bit.

575
00:48:10,018 --> 00:48:11,575
Even the sound of the doorbell sounds better

576
00:48:11,787 --> 00:48:13,583
I'll open the door more quickly.

577
00:48:14,056 --> 00:48:15,044
Wrong delivery

578
00:48:15,190 --> 00:48:16,315
It's stupid to send the wrong one.

579
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:18,290
This shoe box is a little heavy.

580
00:48:18,527 --> 00:48:19,652
Please walk faster.

581
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:27,858
Boss, be careful.

582
00:48:28,402 --> 00:48:30,028
run fast

583
00:48:37,878 --> 00:48:40,175
Woman's name and phone number on Mouthwatering Springs

584
00:48:40,481 --> 00:48:42,243
It's all the work of this tattoo expert.

585
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:43,909
I hope he'll remember.

586
00:48:45,853 --> 00:48:48,252
Cock-eye, do me a favor. Think again for me.

587
00:48:48,489 --> 00:48:50,752
What's been carved into the fountain of mouth lately?

588
00:48:51,392 --> 00:48:53,655
It's either a woman's name or a phone number.

589
00:48:54,061 --> 00:48:56,893
He's covered in it. I remember that.

590
00:48:57,131 --> 00:48:59,360
Has he brought any girls to get tattooed lately?

591
00:49:00,067 --> 00:49:02,125
Yes, two.

592
00:49:02,336 --> 00:49:05,736
That's ridiculous. He told me to carve letters into the asses of those 
two girls.

593
00:49:07,674 --> 00:49:09,436
You must remember what was carved there.

594
00:49:10,043 --> 00:49:14,001
If everyone remembers, I'll have to install a computer here.

595
00:49:18,218 --> 00:49:19,946
Good. Now there are fewer clues.

596
00:49:20,420 --> 00:49:21,647
Less chance of finding diamonds again.

597
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,820
Your chances of going to jail are a little closer.

598
00:49:24,057 --> 00:49:27,355
You're in a bit of a hurry. There's still some thread, but it's a little 
harder.

599
00:49:27,394 --> 00:49:28,360
What do you mean?

600
00:49:28,395 --> 00:49:30,487
As Izumi was dying, he shouted "Rose!

601
00:49:30,797 --> 00:49:33,230
I suspect he may have a girlfriend named Rose.

602
00:49:33,466 --> 00:49:34,454
sir

603
00:49:35,035 --> 00:49:37,594
Did you two just get out of the tattoo parlor?

604
00:49:37,704 --> 00:49:38,692
be

605
00:49:38,905 --> 00:49:41,771
Then it's time to take a picture at my place.

606
00:49:41,975 --> 00:49:42,963
Why?

607
00:49:43,009 --> 00:49:46,739
Because everyone who gets a tattoo likes to come to my photo booth for 
pictures.

608
00:49:47,846 --> 00:49:49,369
Can't get to the mouth of the water spring he

609
00:49:49,581 --> 00:49:52,378
Don't be embarrassed. This is the one.

610
00:49:54,019 --> 00:49:55,679
rose

611
00:49:57,656 --> 00:49:59,646
Madam, we're not here to take pictures.

612
00:50:02,161 --> 00:50:04,492
Why don't you take a picture? To fish in the water?

613
00:50:04,763 --> 00:50:06,491
Come on, let's go.

614
00:50:07,633 --> 00:50:08,963
We're trying to get a picture for a friend.

615
00:50:09,301 --> 00:50:10,494
Who is it?

616
00:50:11,103 --> 00:50:12,967
Has anyone taken any nude pictures here lately?

617
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:15,328
Rowan

618
00:50:16,442 --> 00:50:18,238
So you're friends of Rowan's.

619
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:20,634
No, we're friends from Fountain of Mouth.

620
00:50:21,213 --> 00:50:23,077
Who are you talking about?

621
00:50:23,315 --> 00:50:25,612
The girl's phone number is engraved all over.

622
00:50:25,818 --> 00:50:27,910
I can't talk, I can't talk, I can't talk, I can't talk.

623
00:50:28,653 --> 00:50:30,916
I see. Red cat, right?

624
00:50:31,122 --> 00:50:32,110
That's right.

625
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:35,224
That poor guy dropped two bucks and disappeared.

626
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:37,649
Those pictures are very important to us.

627
00:50:37,862 --> 00:50:39,886
No, I don't know where they put it.

628
00:50:40,031 --> 00:50:41,793
I'm busy here. Let's go.

629
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:42,987
Give me a hand.

630
00:50:43,401 --> 00:50:47,131
Let me do it. You watch the door and tell me when someone comes.

631
00:50:52,176 --> 00:50:53,574
You're in trouble.

632
00:51:03,221 --> 00:51:04,847
What? Robbery?

633
00:51:05,289 --> 00:51:06,277
No

634
00:51:07,958 --> 00:51:09,083
I have a husband's

635
00:51:09,659 --> 00:51:11,455
It's okay.

636
00:51:11,695 --> 00:51:12,683
I'm very old.

637
00:51:12,929 --> 00:51:14,520
Just right.

638
00:51:14,698 --> 00:51:15,755
I'm not pretty.

639
00:51:15,866 --> 00:51:17,389
I can settle.

640
00:51:23,039 --> 00:51:28,203
What did you give me? It's a stocking

641
00:51:28,411 --> 00:51:30,275
So she won't recognize my face.

642
00:51:31,581 --> 00:51:34,276
Why don't you put one on, too, so she doesn't recognize you?

643
00:51:34,718 --> 00:51:35,877
No.

644
00:51:46,195 --> 00:51:48,662
Don't mess around. I'll just give you the photos.

645
00:51:53,736 --> 00:51:55,726
high bar

646
00:52:10,452 --> 00:52:11,440
Both of them are here.

647
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:16,556
I found out. The first girl works for this taxi company.

648
00:52:16,725 --> 00:52:17,952
I'll deal with it alone later.

649
00:52:17,993 --> 00:52:18,924
Why?

650
00:52:18,961 --> 00:52:21,793
You can only deal with old ladies like that. This is a big girl.

651
00:52:21,964 --> 00:52:22,952
Of course it's up to me.

652
00:52:23,432 --> 00:52:24,591
That's not really true.

653
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:27,768
I was in the Most Attractive Man contest in Chinatown.

654
00:52:27,802 --> 00:52:28,790
What happened?

655
00:52:28,837 --> 00:52:29,962
Of course, I'm the winner.

656
00:52:30,004 --> 00:52:30,935
How many people attended

657
00:52:30,972 --> 00:52:32,097
I'm the only one.

658
00:52:32,974 --> 00:52:34,600
Anyway, don't say anything later.

659
00:52:35,443 --> 00:52:38,843
You know what, kid? I'm on the case. I'll take care of the girls.

660
00:52:39,314 --> 00:52:40,678
Hello.

661
00:52:44,819 --> 00:52:47,651
What are you doing, damn it? Don't waste your time. Let's go.

662
00:52:49,324 --> 00:52:50,688
Who did you just say hello to?

663
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:53,651
Who spanked my ass and hit me on the head again?

664
00:52:55,296 --> 00:52:57,229
Wait, you watch. I'll deal with the girl.

665
00:52:57,365 --> 00:52:58,353
No, I have to say it.

666
00:52:58,433 --> 00:52:59,421
I told you not to make a sound.

667
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:00,228
I have to say.

668
00:53:00,268 --> 00:53:01,393
Shh. Shh what?

669
00:53:01,636 --> 00:53:06,231
A traffic vehicle knocked down a traffic light at the entrance of the 
Department of Transportation, causing traffic chaos.

670
00:53:08,842 --> 00:53:10,206
Hello Taxi Service Desk

671
00:53:10,644 --> 00:53:11,632
Got it!

672
00:53:12,546 --> 00:53:14,775
Your wife asks if you're coming home for dinner.

673
00:53:15,015 --> 00:53:18,415
Tell her I'm not going home for dinner. Mary, can I buy you dinner?

674
00:53:18,552 --> 00:53:20,018
Come on, don't flatter yourself.

675
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:22,688
Miss Mary, how are you?

676
00:53:22,723 --> 00:53:23,711
Who are you?

677
00:53:23,757 --> 00:53:26,054
I'm an attorney from Mouthwatering Springs. This is his father, Uncle 
Wong.

678
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:27,648
Hello!

679
00:53:28,962 --> 00:53:32,362
I don't know where he died.

680
00:53:33,634 --> 00:53:35,032
Even you curse him to death!

681
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,937
He's really dead, but we don't know where.

682
00:53:38,972 --> 00:53:39,960
truly

683
00:53:40,007 --> 00:53:42,497
Yeah, and he died a horrible death.

684
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:45,905
When he was dying, he was screaming your name.

685
00:53:48,915 --> 00:53:51,644
He was dying and he called my name.

686
00:53:57,957 --> 00:54:00,891
There's a lady. Her beloved Pekingese is missing.

687
00:54:01,193 --> 00:54:04,127
Anyone who finds one, please notify the taxi desk.

688
00:54:05,164 --> 00:54:07,859
Mr CHAN, this girl is really sympathetic

689
00:54:08,267 --> 00:54:12,828
May God bless that Pekingese.

690
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:15,037
He still has a legacy to leave to you.

691
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:17,636
Legacy? How many?

692
00:54:18,678 --> 00:54:20,076
There's half a million.

693
00:54:20,313 --> 00:54:21,574
It's US dollars.

694
00:54:25,818 --> 00:54:26,806
truly

695
00:54:28,153 --> 00:54:31,121
The Pekinese dog has been found. Thank God. Thank you, Fountain of Water.

696
00:54:32,757 --> 00:54:35,589
Father, Mizukuisen is a man of God.

697
00:54:41,433 --> 00:54:43,400
Make yourselves at home. Don't be polite.

698
00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:47,768
We need proof of your identity before we can complete the paperwork.

699
00:54:48,106 --> 00:54:49,470
No problem. I have an ID card.

700
00:54:49,674 --> 00:54:51,664
No, he wants to see your farts.

701
00:54:52,177 --> 00:54:53,404
The features on her body.

702
00:54:53,878 --> 00:54:56,539
This bastard told you all this.

703
00:54:56,815 --> 00:54:59,476
How would he have seen it if I hadn't gotten drunk that night?

704
00:54:59,684 --> 00:55:00,809
So you're drunk.

705
00:55:01,219 --> 00:55:07,316
I got it. It's the fire department down the alley. There's a fire truck 
outside.

706
00:55:07,558 --> 00:55:10,390
And the coffin truck outside of the funeral home... hit a man.

707
00:55:10,594 --> 00:55:11,685
Real trouble.

708
00:55:12,596 --> 00:55:16,429
It's ridiculous that you guys want to see my ass.

709
00:55:17,901 --> 00:55:19,492
Look at that. Half a million dollars.

710
00:55:21,338 --> 00:55:25,535
Don't say I do. You do too.

711
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:28,541
Am I right?

712
00:55:34,918 --> 00:55:37,010
So what if I don't show it to you?

713
00:55:37,454 --> 00:55:40,786
The estate was automatically transferred to his father, Uncle Wong.

714
00:55:42,659 --> 00:55:44,319
What proof do you have that he's his father?

715
00:55:47,563 --> 00:55:48,927
I love my dad.

716
00:55:50,967 --> 00:55:52,024
Where the hell are we going?

717
00:55:54,604 --> 00:55:59,973
If you take a picture of yourself here, you won't be embarrassed.

718
00:56:00,676 --> 00:56:01,972
No, it's embarrassing.

719
00:56:02,512 --> 00:56:03,637
Half a million dollars.

720
00:56:04,047 --> 00:56:05,035
I don't have any change.

721
00:56:06,082 --> 00:56:08,811
I have it. Take it, please.

722
00:56:12,889 --> 00:56:14,082
No peeking.

723
00:56:14,290 --> 00:56:18,191
Okay, remember, it's not the front, it's the mark on the butt.

724
00:56:19,562 --> 00:56:20,755
should

725
00:56:27,769 --> 00:56:29,030
He's taking a student photo with his daughter

726
00:56:29,237 --> 00:56:31,136
Go to Miss Hong Kong's

727
00:56:44,519 --> 00:56:45,542
older brother

728
00:56:50,559 --> 00:56:53,686
Sir, this photo is yours, and this case is yours.

729
00:56:54,396 --> 00:56:55,555
pay one's respects by bowing with hands in front of one's chest

730
00:56:55,831 --> 00:56:56,922
stand

731
00:56:59,768 --> 00:57:01,564
Who are you two?

732
00:57:13,647 --> 00:57:14,635
Brother CHAN Sing

733
00:57:18,252 --> 00:57:19,445
Brother CHAN Sing

734
00:57:21,388 --> 00:57:22,445
Who is he?

735
00:57:22,756 --> 00:57:25,485
He's the maniacal Hoshiro who killed Mizukuisen.

736
00:57:25,826 --> 00:57:27,850
I don't know him. You can talk to him.

737
00:57:32,533 --> 00:57:33,965
Who are you two again?

738
00:57:37,738 --> 00:57:38,761
This time it was an accident.

739
00:57:42,042 --> 00:57:43,201
I'm not ready yet.

740
00:57:45,346 --> 00:57:47,279
Boy, that's not good.

741
00:57:48,481 --> 00:57:52,780
Don't be afraid. We're two brothers. I'll be here when you die.

742
00:57:54,721 --> 00:57:57,689
Who doesn't know that this site belongs to me, Madman?

743
00:57:58,491 --> 00:58:02,051
How dare you trick my sister into taking nude photos?

744
00:58:02,629 --> 00:58:04,152
Whose idea was it?

745
00:58:04,964 --> 00:58:08,592
I think it's a dead end. Two people can still have a partner.

746
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,427
Admit everything together.

747
00:58:10,637 --> 00:58:11,796
No problem.

748
00:58:12,505 --> 00:58:14,938
Come on, which one of you had the idea?

749
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:16,835
The idea of two people

750
00:58:17,043 --> 00:58:18,373
Who came up with this idea?

751
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,837
We came up with it together.

752
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:23,443
Who asked my sister to take a picture first?

753
00:58:23,616 --> 00:58:25,082
Open your mouth together.

754
00:58:25,485 --> 00:58:26,542
have a certain kind of

755
00:58:26,719 --> 00:58:28,185
Both of them.

756
00:58:28,754 --> 00:58:29,742
That's great.

757
00:58:30,189 --> 00:58:32,918
Both are fine.

758
00:58:42,935 --> 00:58:43,923
What do we do now?

759
00:58:44,136 --> 00:58:45,932
It doesn't matter. You can admit it first.

760
00:58:47,339 --> 00:58:48,999
Whose idea was it?

761
00:58:50,509 --> 00:58:51,941
It's mine for now.

762
00:58:55,614 --> 00:58:56,671
It's so hard.

763
00:58:57,716 --> 00:58:58,773
Do you have a share?

764
00:58:58,984 --> 00:58:59,972
Let's admit it, son.

765
00:59:00,586 --> 00:59:01,847
He said to admit one thing first.

766
00:59:05,857 --> 00:59:08,689
Don't worry, I'll replace you after two breaths.

767
00:59:13,097 --> 00:59:15,462
It's my turn.

768
00:59:15,900 --> 00:59:18,129
My nose isn't as big as yours. I'll have to suck on it a bit more.

769
00:59:18,603 --> 00:59:20,263
Come on, hurry up.

770
00:59:20,438 --> 00:59:21,563
I'm coming up.

771
00:59:24,575 --> 00:59:27,771
It's so nice now. I really don't want to go back up there.

772
00:59:28,312 --> 00:59:30,779
Okay, it's my turn. It's hard work.

773
00:59:31,215 --> 00:59:32,681
You called me a nice one.

774
00:59:33,684 --> 00:59:34,672
older brother

775
00:59:34,819 --> 00:59:36,217
Brother is coming

776
00:59:36,254 --> 00:59:39,882
I've fallen for it, brother. Let me down.

777
00:59:40,224 --> 00:59:42,748
What's the hurry? The air is good up there

778
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:46,629
You little bastard, don't put me down yet. You want to hang me?

779
00:59:49,065 --> 00:59:53,057
I can't. I'm dying. I'm dying.

780
00:59:57,841 --> 00:59:58,864
So you're not dead yet.

781
00:59:59,943 --> 01:00:01,569
You're dead and I'm still alive.

782
01:00:02,012 --> 01:00:03,979
That's not what I said. How could you let me down?

783
01:00:05,415 --> 01:00:06,711
Okay, it's my turn.

784
01:00:06,950 --> 01:00:09,042
No, I need to breathe.

785
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,308
You're not righteous enough.

786
01:00:11,521 --> 01:00:14,080
You're crazy, now you're talking about righteousness, gasping for breath

787
01:00:14,457 --> 01:00:17,687
You hillbilly, you want me to admit first that it was all your idea.

788
01:00:19,596 --> 01:00:21,119
So it was your idea.

789
01:00:27,904 --> 01:00:29,461
That's right. That's right. Stab him a few more times.

790
01:00:29,705 --> 01:00:31,569
Bastard, you have no sense of justice. You want to kill someone with a 
knife.

791
01:00:31,807 --> 01:00:34,900
Fatty, he's the one who asked your sister to take the picture.

792
01:00:36,312 --> 01:00:40,304
What? No, it's not even Hoshi, it's Fatty Hoshi.

793
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:44,944
It's better for me to call him fat to his face than for you to call him a 
bastard behind his back.

794
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,211
What?

795
01:00:54,496 --> 01:00:57,259
Bastard wants to catch his breath. Now you're in trouble.

796
01:00:57,933 --> 01:01:02,494
Don't worry, I know this place well. There's no train coming.

797
01:01:02,971 --> 01:01:03,959
No train.

798
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:14,073
There's no train. You could be rolled over in four pieces. Come on.

799
01:01:48,715 --> 01:01:50,511
What's the point of staying in a hospital for something so trivial?

800
01:01:50,851 --> 01:01:53,375
And you have to specify this floor. This one.

801
01:01:53,820 --> 01:01:55,650
Well, it's not good enough to let you rest.

802
01:01:56,156 --> 01:01:59,352
If anything happens, just ring the bell and call me.

803
01:01:59,526 --> 01:02:01,755
Yeah, that's not true.

804
01:02:52,111 --> 01:02:53,668
You two treat me like I'm invisible.

805
01:02:55,748 --> 01:02:57,339
I've got other patients to see.

806
01:03:04,857 --> 01:03:07,654
I have a chance with Doraemon, but not you and the man-child.

807
01:03:07,893 --> 01:03:09,655
I can't. I haven't had my fun yet.

808
01:03:10,061 --> 01:03:11,823
That's nice. She's meaner than you.

809
01:03:12,130 --> 01:03:13,960
Those two guys are in that room.

810
01:03:14,532 --> 01:03:16,021
The man-child is here.

811
01:03:16,701 --> 01:03:18,600
You're not leaving. Now you have to help me.

812
01:03:19,137 --> 01:03:22,867
These two fucking bastards left me to go investigate the case by myself.

813
01:03:23,208 --> 01:03:25,072
I'm gonna have to go after them.

814
01:03:25,810 --> 01:03:26,798
What did you say?

815
01:03:26,845 --> 01:03:30,041
How can you call Ho Tung Sze a man-child? She's my dream girl.

816
01:03:31,149 --> 01:03:35,084
She may be mean, but she's made of women from head to toe.

817
01:03:35,353 --> 01:03:37,445
How come you don't see the soft side of her?

818
01:03:37,755 --> 01:03:40,484
I'm telling you, I'm after her now.

819
01:03:41,192 --> 01:03:42,522
She's a divine woman.

820
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,387
When did she ever cross her arms in front of us?

821
01:03:47,098 --> 01:03:48,724
She never yelled at me.

822
01:03:49,100 --> 01:03:54,200
When she's standing.
You look like a lady.

823
01:03:55,750 --> 01:04:00,378
When you're sitting, you look like a little girl. You don't cross your legs.

824
01:04:00,886 --> 01:04:04,718
She's very gentle. You don't believe me. Ask her later when she comes in.

825
01:04:07,524 --> 01:04:08,784
ALBERT

826
01:04:10,427 --> 01:04:11,584
When did you get in?

827
01:04:12,863 --> 01:04:16,796
I just got in. I just wanted to tell you.

828
01:04:16,965 --> 01:04:17,952
Say it.

829
01:04:18,834 --> 01:04:20,628
Tomorrow is my birthday.

830
01:04:28,476 --> 01:04:29,463
I lost it.

831
01:04:30,210 --> 01:04:31,435
What are you doing in here again?

832
01:04:32,046 --> 01:04:33,670
I forgot to get my clothes.

833
01:04:50,561 --> 01:04:51,651
older sister

834
01:04:58,701 --> 01:05:01,361
What's wrong with my sister? I've never seen her like this before.

835
01:05:05,808 --> 01:05:10,072
She's fine. You better get her checked out by a brain surgeon.

836
01:05:11,679 --> 01:05:14,304
HELLO Man Woman Phone

837
01:05:18,051 --> 01:05:19,913
Your sister's phone.

838
01:05:21,487 --> 01:05:26,218
Doraemon, I can hear my phone outside.

839
01:05:35,066 --> 01:05:37,258
Manny, I'm a marginalized person

840
01:05:37,735 --> 01:05:42,830
You're a fucking marginal. I asked you to check on the maniacs, and now you're 
calling me.

841
01:05:43,306 --> 01:05:44,703
She can't change her nature.

842
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,531
And torture her a little.

843
01:05:47,008 --> 01:05:49,132
What? To kill the bald detective?

844
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:50,605
You tell him.

845
01:05:50,846 --> 01:05:53,243
If he touches the bald detective, I'll kill him.

846
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:57,613
And you, too. If you get in my way, I'm gonna cramp you up.

847
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:05,950
Madman said he'd kill you.

848
01:06:06,193 --> 01:06:08,022
I got it. You go out.

849
01:06:22,706 --> 01:06:24,035
Repair of toilets

850
01:06:34,583 --> 01:06:35,570
It's fixed.

851
01:06:50,097 --> 01:06:51,084
It's broken again.

852
01:07:11,614 --> 01:07:13,273
Boss, OK.

853
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,285
Remote Control

854
01:07:26,127 --> 01:07:29,686
Just press this button, and you're all goodbye.

855
01:07:31,664 --> 01:07:33,129
God bless.

856
01:07:43,141 --> 01:07:44,538
What the fuck are you doing hugging my sister?

857
01:07:48,313 --> 01:07:50,404
Damn it, you're still holding me.

858
01:08:01,056 --> 01:08:03,317
It's your wife's birthday tonight. You have to go back and spend time 
with her.

859
01:08:03,525 --> 01:08:04,512
And you?

860
01:08:04,560 --> 01:08:05,855
How can I make a light bulb?

861
01:08:06,428 --> 01:08:07,653
Tell me the truth.

862
01:08:08,629 --> 01:08:10,423
I have a date with Doraemon

863
01:08:16,468 --> 01:08:19,401
What's with all the darkness? Responding to energy conservation?

864
01:08:25,010 --> 01:08:28,910
albert, look what a difference I made today.

865
01:08:30,448 --> 01:08:33,846
You must have been sent by your superiors to work as an undercover agent for a 
prostitute.

866
01:08:36,753 --> 01:08:40,380
Take your feet off. The couch is dirty.

867
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:43,080
It's my birthday.

868
01:08:43,425 --> 01:08:44,582
What about that?

869
01:08:45,227 --> 01:08:46,886
Let's open the champagne first.

870
01:09:12,684 --> 01:09:13,671
Who made this steak?

871
01:09:15,151 --> 01:09:16,945
I made it myself.

872
01:09:17,222 --> 01:09:18,777
First time in the kitchen

873
01:09:19,023 --> 01:09:20,510
It's awful.

874
01:09:25,762 --> 01:09:27,624
Is it your birthday? - Yes.

875
01:09:27,896 --> 01:09:28,883
How old are you?

876
01:09:29,164 --> 01:09:30,288
Thirty years old

877
01:09:30,599 --> 01:09:33,292
A flower. Congratulations.

878
01:09:34,735 --> 01:09:39,136
No, a man is a flower at 30, a woman is a crap at 30.

879
01:09:41,409 --> 01:09:43,374
Why can't you get married at 30?

880
01:09:44,244 --> 01:09:45,334
No one wants it.

881
01:09:45,912 --> 01:09:46,899
Oh that's true! (interjection of sudden realization)

882
01:09:47,547 --> 01:09:49,012
Did you hear the sound?

883
01:09:49,180 --> 01:09:50,440
What else is there to hear but your voice?

884
01:09:50,683 --> 01:09:55,549
Don't argue. - A bomb!

885
01:09:58,856 --> 01:10:00,821
Climb down. Cover your ears.

886
01:10:02,993 --> 01:10:06,153
Why did I cover my ears and still hear the answer?

887
01:10:07,396 --> 01:10:09,419
It's my family heirloom

888
01:10:10,633 --> 01:10:12,997
You're obviously trying to piss me off, aren't you?

889
01:10:13,068 --> 01:10:15,000
You don't have to mess with the fire. It's big enough already.

890
01:10:15,438 --> 01:10:18,428
If you're not happy to come back, don't come back. No one's asking you to 
come back.

891
01:10:18,773 --> 01:10:20,965
You told me it was your birthday, so I came back.

892
01:10:21,176 --> 01:10:22,606
Do you think I like coming back?

893
01:10:22,777 --> 01:10:23,867
Where are you going?

894
01:10:24,378 --> 01:10:26,138
Eat Wonton Noodles

895
01:10:30,351 --> 01:10:32,043
Answer me. To go or not to go?

896
01:10:32,218 --> 01:10:33,410
not go

897
01:10:39,591 --> 01:10:42,421
It's so annoying. Just call again and we'll go.

898
01:10:45,262 --> 01:10:46,886
Let's go.

899
01:12:17,175 --> 01:12:22,041
tomboy

900
01:13:14,857 --> 01:13:17,722
What are you ashamed of? The rice is already cooked. Come out and make 
coffee.

901
01:13:22,962 --> 01:13:24,621
I got it. The second girl.

902
01:13:24,731 --> 01:13:25,786
It's a ballet.

903
01:13:26,032 --> 01:13:28,191
Tonight at the Event Center

904
01:13:28,334 --> 01:13:30,196
The show is over. We're leaving for Japan first thing in the morning.

905
01:13:30,401 --> 01:13:31,525
Then we're gonna do it tonight.

906
01:13:33,271 --> 01:13:34,428
When I was there.

907
01:13:34,506 --> 01:13:36,562
It must be my call, huh?

908
01:13:37,510 --> 01:13:39,169
Let's do it tonight.

909
01:14:30,354 --> 01:14:32,445
You two get your stuff over there.

910
01:14:32,689 --> 01:14:34,086
What are you two doing here?

911
01:14:37,458 --> 01:14:38,718
We are

912
01:14:38,994 --> 01:14:40,391
It's a fan. I know.

913
01:14:40,563 --> 01:14:44,018
The backstage is important. No one is allowed in.

914
01:14:47,602 --> 01:14:51,729
It's almost your turn. Don't get ready to go. Come on.

915
01:14:56,309 --> 01:14:57,296
Why is there a baby swan?

916
01:14:57,809 --> 01:14:58,796
She's a back-up swan.

917
01:14:59,010 --> 01:15:00,497
Back up. I know. It's backstage preparation.

918
01:15:00,712 --> 01:15:02,574
I don't need you to explain. Go on, go on.

919
01:15:02,847 --> 01:15:04,107
Who told you to wear those clothes?

920
01:15:05,784 --> 01:15:06,908
It's you guys.

921
01:15:07,519 --> 01:15:09,678
Come on, let's go get them.

922
01:15:09,821 --> 01:15:12,309
Go, go, go! Get him!

923
01:15:34,141 --> 01:15:37,006
What the hell? I've been hit.

924
01:15:38,845 --> 01:15:40,901
There it is. I don't see it.

925
01:15:41,180 --> 01:15:42,542
That way.

926
01:15:43,016 --> 01:15:44,810
It's our turn. Come on.

927
01:16:12,173 --> 01:16:13,330
Director, you won the Golden Horse.

928
01:16:13,408 --> 01:16:14,737
You can't spice it up anytime either

929
01:16:14,941 --> 01:16:17,169
What spice? They're here to make a mess.

930
01:16:24,751 --> 01:16:26,011
Don't you run.

931
01:16:26,485 --> 01:16:30,578
Get him to the backstage! Get him to the backstage!

932
01:16:36,060 --> 01:16:40,426
What? Put me down! Put me down!

933
01:16:42,232 --> 01:16:44,857
That's the one. Put me down. Do you hear me?

934
01:16:45,135 --> 01:16:46,190
Watch out, I'm coming.

935
01:16:52,074 --> 01:16:53,061
accomplish

936
01:16:53,108 --> 01:16:54,868
Oh, my God.

937
01:16:55,476 --> 01:16:57,270
Not that one. Put it down.

938
01:16:58,346 --> 01:16:59,470
I'm sorry.

939
01:16:59,913 --> 01:17:00,900
It's this one.

940
01:17:01,048 --> 01:17:04,640
Is that her, Dad?

941
01:17:15,460 --> 01:17:17,289
How could this happen? I can't even look at it.

942
01:17:18,862 --> 01:17:21,590
Great! Great!

943
01:17:21,765 --> 01:17:25,130
I see the audience likes this kind of stuff. I'm breaking through again.

944
01:17:36,678 --> 01:17:38,200
Let's go. We're getting off the stage.

945
01:17:39,647 --> 01:17:44,343
That's great. That's great. Get out there and keep dancing.

946
01:17:45,052 --> 01:17:46,881
You dance.

947
01:17:47,455 --> 01:17:49,751
Go? Go?

948
01:17:50,123 --> 01:17:56,117
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

949
01:17:56,963 --> 01:18:00,328
NANCY, NANCY, come back, NANCY!

950
01:18:01,433 --> 01:18:02,625
That way down.

951
01:18:06,471 --> 01:18:07,958
Go to the curtain. Go to the curtain.

952
01:18:09,874 --> 01:18:11,703
The curtain falls. The curtain falls.

953
01:18:13,576 --> 01:18:18,067
Good, good, good.

954
01:18:18,480 --> 01:18:19,467
The lights are falling.

955
01:18:19,614 --> 01:18:21,546
Come on, get back up. I'm sorry.

956
01:18:22,517 --> 01:18:26,450
Okay, okay.

957
01:18:29,723 --> 01:18:34,521
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

958
01:19:22,802 --> 01:19:23,789
What are you doing?

959
01:19:23,836 --> 01:19:27,496
Just change your clothes quickly. Don't get in the way.

960
01:19:27,741 --> 01:19:29,228
That way.

961
01:19:38,681 --> 01:19:39,941
What are you looking at?

962
01:19:57,498 --> 01:19:58,793
Cheers

963
01:20:02,168 --> 01:20:03,565
According to my computer's analysis.

964
01:20:03,837 --> 01:20:07,167
The clue left by Mouthwater's death was two hearts.

965
01:20:07,606 --> 01:20:10,539
If you erase these two hearts, you're left with a bunch of words.

966
01:20:10,808 --> 01:20:13,104
Mizukuisen always likes to do things horizontally.

967
01:20:13,445 --> 01:20:14,500
Then let's look at it sideways.

968
01:20:16,414 --> 01:20:17,901
The first line is MAP

969
01:20:18,216 --> 01:20:19,203
It's a map.

970
01:20:19,249 --> 01:20:20,236
Smart

971
01:20:20,384 --> 01:20:22,713
Wasn't Kusuiquan always emphasizing Kowloon before he died?

972
01:20:23,186 --> 01:20:25,277
So let's take a look at the map of Kowloon

973
01:20:29,158 --> 01:20:30,918
The second line is P6

974
01:20:32,126 --> 01:20:36,026
P6

975
01:20:38,533 --> 01:20:39,520
It's the sea.

976
01:20:39,567 --> 01:20:40,554
Not bad.

977
01:20:40,634 --> 01:20:43,624
So what's the final clue, B3?

978
01:20:43,938 --> 01:20:44,925
What?

979
01:20:45,472 --> 01:20:47,404
Then I don't know.

980
01:20:49,408 --> 01:20:52,068
B3 is this buoy.

981
01:20:52,378 --> 01:20:53,365
Not bad.

982
01:20:53,513 --> 01:20:55,877
Your partner is really something.

983
01:20:56,082 --> 01:20:57,069
Just like you.

984
01:20:57,114 --> 01:20:58,874
That's right. The diamond must be under the buoy.

985
01:20:59,117 --> 01:21:00,104
Must be.

986
01:21:02,053 --> 01:21:03,677
Oh, no. I can't swim.

987
01:21:03,888 --> 01:21:04,875
Neither will I.

988
01:21:04,923 --> 01:21:06,615
I'll get you down first.

989
01:21:08,591 --> 01:21:09,578
That's how it works.

990
01:21:09,625 --> 01:21:10,680
You fucking bald guy.

991
01:21:21,904 --> 01:21:24,427
Found it.

992
01:21:39,051 --> 01:21:40,675
Don't you run. I'll catch up.

993
01:21:41,353 --> 01:21:43,649
Don't chase him. That bag is a fake. It's really here.

994
01:21:44,321 --> 01:21:45,308
You're still good.

995
01:21:54,531 --> 01:21:55,996
Dead bald guy.

996
01:22:03,638 --> 01:22:04,625
You're just in time.

997
01:22:04,705 --> 01:22:06,397
You can have the diamond back. I'm not guilty, am I?

998
01:22:06,708 --> 01:22:07,695
It's done.

999
01:22:08,509 --> 01:22:09,531
What are you doing here again?

1000
01:22:10,210 --> 01:22:12,004
I'll bring the car to you.

1001
01:22:12,211 --> 01:22:15,201
You should go back. The white glove smells like a police officer.

1002
01:22:15,382 --> 01:22:16,472
It wouldn't have happened.

1003
01:22:17,016 --> 01:22:19,574
If you need anything, just call me. I've brought a thousand men to help 
you.

1004
01:22:20,653 --> 01:22:21,640
Come on, let's go.

1005
01:22:21,688 --> 01:22:22,675
Go back and put water in my bath.

1006
01:22:22,921 --> 01:22:23,908
Got it!

1007
01:22:26,824 --> 01:22:31,350
ALBERT, PUT YOUR CLOTHES ON, YOU'LL GET COLD.

1008
01:22:33,264 --> 01:22:36,719
Fake kindness, afraid I'd smuggle it in, staring at me with a radio.

1009
01:22:38,568 --> 01:22:39,555
See how you stare.

1010
01:22:42,237 --> 01:22:43,361
Come on, come on, come on.

1011
01:22:43,405 --> 01:22:44,028
Hurry up.

1012
01:22:44,073 --> 01:22:45,060
It's not fast.

1013
01:22:57,684 --> 01:23:00,344
I thought you said you'd laid a net.

1014
01:23:00,922 --> 01:23:04,287
You can't reveal the truth. It's either you or him this time.

1015
01:23:04,656 --> 01:23:05,643
And you?

1016
01:23:05,690 --> 01:23:07,212
I'm just waiting to see how you two die.

1017
01:23:16,734 --> 01:23:19,667
The White Glove's coming after us. Come on.

1018
01:23:40,088 --> 01:23:41,780
I think it's his death, not yours.

1019
01:23:44,991 --> 01:23:47,287
That's not right. The two of us bullying him.

1020
01:23:47,927 --> 01:23:49,586
Give you a chance to show off.

1021
01:23:49,828 --> 01:23:50,815
And you?

1022
01:23:50,929 --> 01:23:52,861
I'm saving it for the big show.

1023
01:24:15,116 --> 01:24:16,671
That's a big scene, isn't it? Your turn.

1024
01:24:16,985 --> 01:24:20,350
That's great... we'll get rid of all the horses.

1025
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:21,609
What army?

1026
01:24:21,922 --> 01:24:23,114
Calling a man-child with a radio?

1027
01:24:23,323 --> 01:24:24,310
I threw away the radio.

1028
01:24:24,357 --> 01:24:25,117
What?

1029
01:24:25,158 --> 01:24:27,214
What? You said you had a net set up.

1030
01:24:27,427 --> 01:24:28,687
I don't have a net here.

1031
01:25:02,825 --> 01:25:05,586
Oh, no, you're useless. Let me do it. Let me do it.

1032
01:25:05,759 --> 01:25:07,088
Don't move. Let me do it.

1033
01:25:10,163 --> 01:25:11,150
Be careful. Be careful.

1034
01:25:13,799 --> 01:25:14,786
Let me do it.

1035
01:25:14,835 --> 01:25:15,992
Don't move. Go.

1036
01:25:17,470 --> 01:25:19,162
Stop the car. Stop the car. Stop the car.

1037
01:25:19,505 --> 01:25:21,367
Get back! Get back!

1038
01:25:24,642 --> 01:25:27,108
Surrender! He surrendered! He surrendered!

1039
01:25:38,588 --> 01:25:42,681
You're useless. You're just like a car. You're a good-looking, useless 
thing.

1040
01:25:43,259 --> 01:25:45,487
Stop it. Ask them to eat the pineapple.

1041
01:25:48,662 --> 01:25:49,649
Underneath

1042
01:25:49,965 --> 01:25:51,089
Good idea.

1043
01:26:05,344 --> 01:26:06,639
You're doing good, little man.

1044
01:26:23,860 --> 01:26:26,019
I see so many stars.

1045
01:26:26,162 --> 01:26:27,149
Are you okay?

1046
01:26:27,196 --> 01:26:27,784
Not at the moment.

1047
01:26:27,830 --> 01:26:29,454
Get over there. Come on.

1048
01:26:34,501 --> 01:26:35,124
What's up?

1049
01:26:35,170 --> 01:26:35,826
dig a hole in the ground

1050
01:26:35,869 --> 01:26:36,856
Digging a hole in the ground

1051
01:26:41,574 --> 01:26:42,561
What is it?

1052
01:26:42,608 --> 01:26:43,903
It's a net!

1053
01:27:37,455 --> 01:27:38,442
Ha! That was fun.

1054
01:27:38,488 --> 01:27:39,475
careful

1055
01:27:57,905 --> 01:27:58,892
Let me have a good time.

1056
01:27:59,140 --> 01:28:00,127
Get out of the way.

1057
01:28:12,651 --> 01:28:13,638
I want to escape.

1058
01:28:16,088 --> 01:28:17,075
I'll come.

1059
01:28:17,121 --> 01:28:18,108
Don't move.

1060
01:28:29,699 --> 01:28:30,856
Yeah, you're good at it.

1061
01:28:31,801 --> 01:28:32,823
That's not a cover.

1062
01:28:37,505 --> 01:28:38,560
Are you all right?

1063
01:28:39,274 --> 01:28:40,534
I'm fine.

1064
01:28:42,944 --> 01:28:44,431
I have something.

1065
01:28:48,149 --> 01:28:49,136
You don't mind, do you?

1066
01:30:19,593 --> 01:30:23,425
Help. I can't swim.

1067
01:30:29,201 --> 01:30:33,932
What are you doing? Nothing to see. Go away.

1068
01:30:35,740 --> 01:30:37,569
What are you doing? Get out of the way. Get out of the way.

1069
01:30:37,642 --> 01:30:38,629
How's he doing now?

1070
01:30:38,676 --> 01:30:41,642
There's nothing to see. Go away.

1071
01:30:42,345 --> 01:30:43,867
Come down. Come down.

1072
01:30:44,047 --> 01:30:45,034
Let him go.

1073
01:30:49,284 --> 01:30:50,646
Dr. Lam, he's coming up too.

1074
01:30:51,387 --> 01:30:55,719
Let him go. One's a freak, one's a psycho.

1075
01:30:56,025 --> 01:31:01,517
It's a perfect match. Drive.

1076
01:31:16,875 --> 01:31:18,135
Thank you.

1077
01:31:26,750 --> 01:31:30,514
You're a man, crying like a woman. I'm laughing.

1078
01:31:32,288 --> 01:31:33,718
lit. hairy spleen

1079
01:31:34,256 --> 01:31:37,381
If there's a conflict, you and I can do it.

1080
01:31:37,692 --> 01:31:40,590
Put aside your fears and sit down to talk

1081
01:31:41,063 --> 01:31:44,895
You need help, I'll help.

1082
01:31:45,199 --> 01:31:49,395
It doesn't matter how hard it is.

1083
01:31:49,769 --> 01:31:52,759
You're by my side, and I'm no longer on the sidelines.

1084
01:31:53,106 --> 01:31:56,164
Both of them are brave.

1085
01:31:56,508 --> 01:31:58,063
I'm all set.

1086
01:31:58,445 --> 01:32:00,069
You won't panic.

1087
01:32:00,411 --> 01:32:03,571
Best Partner

1088
01:32:24,100 --> 01:32:27,430
If there's a conflict, you and I can do it.

1089
01:32:27,734 --> 01:32:30,757
Put aside your fears and sit down to talk

1090
01:32:31,472 --> 01:32:34,837
You need help, I'll help.

1091
01:32:35,108 --> 01:32:39,008
It doesn't matter how hard it is.

1092
01:32:39,211 --> 01:32:42,644
You're by my side, and I'm no longer on the sidelines.

1093
01:32:42,948 --> 01:32:46,143
Both of them are brave.

1094
01:32:46,583 --> 01:32:48,070
I'm all set.

1095
01:32:48,452 --> 01:32:49,974
You can rest in peace

1096
01:32:50,287 --> 01:32:52,310
Best Partner

1097
01:32:52,456 --> 01:32:55,980
I'm the best partner.

1098
01:32:56,126 --> 01:33:00,322
Always the best partner
