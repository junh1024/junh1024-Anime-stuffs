
1
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,166
Thanks a lot.

2
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,047
Wow, Maki-chan! Vu low


00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,912
The old trustees ﹥ the son and

4
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,969
Yes, no. LIFT is bad.

5
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,055
SORRY, BYE.

6
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,559
Mee-woo!

7
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:44,159
Drink! Hustle, hustle, hustle! Unh!

8
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,377
Do you have a good understanding of the world?

9
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,296
I'll give you a head start.

10
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,590
I don't want the whole thing.

11
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,220
And you've got a great ride. - Oh, forced laughter.

12
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,763
It's hot with Indian curry.

13
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
I'm sorry, you bastard. Old Dou told me to do as you say.

14
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,648
I'll cover you up. You're in the salt water.

15
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,357
I know, I'm wrong.

16
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,441
The next step is to choke on your own.

17
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,067
Airplane

18
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:17,734
Same as

00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,777
Yacht

20
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,611
B

21
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,905
Choke on it, don't worry, put the paper down.

22
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,031
Don't go now, yo!

23
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,284
Yes, paper pigeons, paper songs

24
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,369
Come on!

25
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,390
Bye. - Bye.

26
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,484
Hello, Roberto.

27
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,070
Hello, good to see you.

28
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,530
Are you having a good time in Hong Kong?

29
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,239
I'm sorry.

30
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,699
Godfather, don't pretend.

31
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,450
I'm all right.

32
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,494
He waits for you and sees that you have good luck.

33
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,620

roast antonio

35
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,218
Go ahead, Aimee.

36
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,558
Bake António, right?

37
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,648
Do you have a U?
What's wrong with you?

38
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,441
roast antonio

39
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,696
You give me a hard time every time you have something to do.

40
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,950
I know which side is sighing.

41
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,911
White Hand Daisy

42
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,250
What about him?

43
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,543
Venice

44
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,430
I believe you.

45
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,100
I won't do it, Godfather.

46
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,896
You go to Hong Kong and help me with the diamond stall?

47
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,481
What do you mean, pick me?

48
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,319
Do as I say, or you'll die.

49
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,406
You can use our suo Hong Kong brown relationship

50
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,616
I could do without the diamonds.

51
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,370
But do not let the Italians lose face!

52
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,788
I'm British!

53
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,123
Loggerheads

54
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,503
Don't you know that Britain and Italy are cousins?

55
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,130
I've never heard of it.

56
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,008
Put down the diamond, or you'll die.

57
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,656
According to the survey ...

58
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:43,077
You and Kikiya must not talk about Saisoi

59
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,621
You can say anything.

60
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,623
Wah, you talk.

61
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,958
Recent relationships
Tsim Sha Tsui Centre

62
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,169
A serious incident of wiring robbery occurred

63
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,380
A group of diamond salaries worth a fortune were looted.

64
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,174
No one has reported the case.

65
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,676
We have obtained the following information

66
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,271
This is a member of the local Mumbai triad.

67
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,733
He is called Szeto Buren and he steals rats.

68
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,781
This is a newcomer to the international smuggling syndicate

69
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,867
He is an Italian called Montezzuto.

70
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,786
In the case of the single robbery.

71
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,789
There is no sigh of loss in the case of Szeto.

72
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,043
And this Italian, he didn't even report the case.

73
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,505
What about the low line?

74
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,757
It's just a white hand sock.

75
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,553
As for the sale of further information, there is a void.

76
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,974
The above information is from our source

77
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,892
From our land.

78
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,894
As he shouted about his special status

79
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,522
That's why we can't make your name public.

80
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,232
The whistle, the snake, Ming's?

81
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,568
Noisy, don't break the century atmosphere

82
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,072
This is the world's most famous thief.

83
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,993
He is called "White Hand Socks" and specializes in robbing diamonds and gold

84
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,290
He has seven passports, eight names, nine identities

85
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,458
Two sexes are buried together

86
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,712
It's not a case in Hong Kong.

87
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,756
You can talk to Hong Kong people about brownies.

88
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,552
It can also be said that Hong Kong people are unhappy

89
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,596
Therefore, we must have specific rules.

90
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,682
Put her on the market.

91
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,183
Dead right?

92
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,478
Yes, he has two rivals.

93
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,940
The first one is the Pink Panther Red Petershaker.

94
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,484
It is a pity that he has been called by the Lord

95
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,279
The second one is that he is ...

96
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,697
Don't stop Chiu!

97
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,283
Drinking in the United States

98
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,909
For fucks sake, white socks.

99
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,871
He changed from a flower to a wordless flower

100
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,290
From Chai Tau to Bald Head

101
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,002
At the same time he ordered him, by a mark on his face, to do so within three months.

102
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,670
If you can't catch a white sock

103
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,716
We need to make an early contribution to the pension scheme and wash the dumplings

104
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,555
Therefore, we decided to invite the lamb-headed grandfather to visit Hong Kong.

105
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,975
Because he is the most enthusiastic about catching white socks and shouting at people

106
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,229
As for the most outstanding young female Superintendent of Police in Jiaochuan this year

107
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,773
What about the poem of Ho Tung?

108
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,483
A man's wife!

109
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,817
We'll send him.

110
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,862
The Office of the Inspector General of the Kwong Tau Estate

111
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,655
What a choke! What a choke!

112
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,247
Hustle Keti, is there a fire?

113
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,003
Silence, little sister! Yes!

114
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,005
I've got fire all around me.

115
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,548
But it's a good one, yo.

116

Secret Nun Fake Authentic Brown Hustle

117
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
I want to see the relationship.

118
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,808
Oh, it's a mess!

119
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,685
Good blink!

120
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,857
Brown, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.

121
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,567
My gun goes off all the time, Joe Koo.

122
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,945
It's all her fault. It's none of my business, Ada.

123
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,113
I don't dare to go down there.

124
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,367
Go away, you're the best of the day!

125
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:09,909
I am?

126
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:10,868
I pay you to die.

127
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,078
Is a vegetable stalk a vegetable bush?

128
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:12,829
Let's go.

129
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,293
Have you seen a woman with a big spleen in the village?

130
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,087
Oh, I have a gun bag for you in the morning.

131
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,923
What about the police superintendent, who is in charge of the light-headed detectors?

132
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,466
I'll have to take it.

133
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,218
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

134
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,512
So many people, how can you do it?

135
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,348
You'll agree with me if I make a big bel belch.

136
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,724
She's ready to go now

137
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,601
People on the Edge!

138
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,019
Well, well, well!

139
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,771
Mimi, go!

140
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,107
Don't move your lips!

141
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:42,984
You, Chung, go!

142
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,644
Shut up! Shut up!

143
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,692
No one is here. Oh, my God!

144
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,946
I'll cover up my identity with you. What? Do you have any information?

145
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,450
There are three singles, two are firm, and one is a stream of shouting

146
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,661
Then speak two languages and be quiet.

147
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,957
That's the American bald guy.

148
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,834
The boss sent you to help him with his investigation.

149
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,419
You know all the information about my place.

150
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,796
Don't do that.

151
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,298
What is it?

152
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,674
Yes, that's right.

153
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,052
Some people in Kowloon City are trying to rob Chow Tai Fook Gold Company on Sunday.

154
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,303
Do you know that today is the day?

155
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,888
I'm with him.

156
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,557
Is it a good day?

157
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,936
But it's not a good day.

158
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,314
Noisy, is there a single whisper?

159
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:04,732
What's that?

160
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,776
It's just that the boss said you wouldn't pick up the plane at the airport today.

161
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,945
Just send me around the living ancient

162
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,780
But, I'm sorry, I've knocked you down.

163
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,697
It's really darker than ink beans

164
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,450
Oh, yeah?

165
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:17,870
Howl!

166
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,082
I'm going to investigate the case.

00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,367
My name is a shame.

176
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,369
I'm all right.

177
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,298
Hello, old man.

For a while, someone was choking on your salary.

If you want to feel ashamed of leaving, it's easy to do it quickly.

203
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:00,866
Make it sweet. I want to die.

204
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,867
Do you want to send us to an ambulance?

Have you just been smuggled in?

You're not to blame for walking.

Are you familiar with the laws of Hong Kong, country bumpkin?

232
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,445
Hong Kong legislation is not familiar

233
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,531
American law is familiar to you.

234
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,616
The landlord, Quaran, learns to rob

235

The time has fallen.

00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:49,743
Don't like it.

237
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,121
Swim in the water.

238
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,873
I'm leaving the plane for Joe.

239
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,832
Do you have any friends in Hong Kong?

240
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,042
Not for my relatives, not for my friends.

241
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,377
He knows that if I shout, there is one

242
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,253
It's the edge.

243
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,254
Hong Kong

244
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,050
He called me and asked me to come, Joe.

245
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,678
Ding, ding, ding, ding!

246
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,847
Countryman, I'll sing you a song.

247
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,057
You may not do it, if you want to scare me.

248
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,518
It can be used as a showcase in the future.

249
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:18,981
What is the name of the choke?

250
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,650
ALBERR Qiao A Shi, Ou Shuiqiang

251
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,862
Hey, the whole continent is crying out with the English language.

252
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,280
How can you be so powerful in the countryside?

253
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,114
Taishan

254
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,073
The marriage has not yet been consummated.

255
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,700
What about you?

256
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,244
What's the matter with you, sex?

257
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,413
Ahjumma, I have a whisker.

258
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,331
Then what is it again?

259
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,208
A man is a man if he's got beard brown, just like you.

260
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,753
The head is not like a man, and the body is not like a woman

261
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,088
And now they are neither male nor female

262
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,590
You're begging and choking. - Don't shush.

263
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,551
Are you kidding?

264
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,181
I won't hit you, you hit me!

265
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,976
Ha, what a choke, what a choke, what a choke!

266
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,689
But the name is true.

267
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,567
I don't think so. Auntie, you're choking.

268
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,153
Superintendent He's choking.

269
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:10,324
It's working fast, but it's slow to take the gun.

270
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,452
I'm the Commissioner of Police.

271
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,496
Help you with this case, Joe.

272
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,581
He's so worried.

273
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,917
To protect your brown identity from the noise.

274
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,128
I've arranged for you to be married as husband and wife.

275
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,089
What are you talking about? He's playing my husband.

276
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,299
He's a loser. He's not worthy of being my husband.

277
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,801
She's a deadbeat.

278
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,136
含 ， 吨 吨 吨 ， 元 女 包 ， 我 殷 你

279
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,763
Fatty, let's go to the hotel together.

280
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,347
Put it down. - Yuck.

281
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,016
I'm singing, I'm leaving the room.

282
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,309
I'm going to be her husband.

283
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,352
You! Think!

284
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,522
Huh? A-x... -jˊl...

285
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,564
I'm going to do it.

286
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,567
I'm not used to staying in hotels, so I dare to stay in my house

287
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,610
You House Enterprise?

288
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,444
You're a beauty!

289
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,281
You're taking over her house and there's a ghost in it.

290
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,705
Noisy, bald guy, you don't want to be with my girl

291
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,790
All the police stations are clear. I'm a man, Joe.

292
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:00,833
Remember...

293
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,086
We're a couple. You're so cute.

294
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,798
I'm sorry, I've never seen it before.

295
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,968
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

296
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,183
According to the information provided by the Border Control Unit

297
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,644
Drinking diamonds is what this pretty boy does.

298
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,648
His name is King Kong and he is known as the Flying Toad

299
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,817
She has a partner called "The Eye".

300
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:30,195
She is called Sze Shui Chuen, known as the Lady's Pool.

301
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,740
You're looking at her. She's a woman's phone.

302
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,826
She never showed up after her two kissing sessions.

303
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,245
Kim just lived on the fifth floor of this building.

Hey, Kim Lee, it's Soo Sang.

306
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,857
And I was called by a different name...

307
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,734
Red Cat CALL Black Cat OVER

308
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,360
The black cat hears the panting and speaks smack

309
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,155
Report to Black Cat. I'm going to bury the diamond.

310
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,240
You're talking about diamond peanuts again

311
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,951
I'll take the bawl, and I'll talk to you.

312
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,413
If you don't talk better than I do, I'll start [Diao Meng Noise

313
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,248
I know, but you know.

314
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,793
If I don't talk more than you, I can't do it

315
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,668
What do you mean?

316
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,379
Because I'm a barking maniac!

317
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,507
Unh! You're so bilious!

318
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,716
Fuyan, you're dead!

319
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,968
Why don't you go out and get a restaurant?

320
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,595
Good Un, Bian Qun Un?

321
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,555
I'm not as good as you.

322
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,100
You don't know what I'm singing.

323
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,439
I'm quieter than you are, and you listen to the dusty black cat.

00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,707
Come on, D, go to Seventh Heaven Restaurant for coffee. Black Cat is waiting for you.

329
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,210
You're so noisy.

330
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,629
Diamond Pack, Dbitu Black Cat!

331
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,090
It's not diamonds, it's peanuts.

332
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,637
It's him.

333
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,530
Oh! White hand socks! It's him! Return it

334
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,616
King Kong!

335
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,784
Oh, my God!

336
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,371
Let's go, Kim!

337
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,040
No, Jo, it's not him, it's another Un!

338
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,607
Wow, what a show of life!

339
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,561
According to the old car first

340
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,520
Dead man's bag!

341
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,855
Bye, baldy.

342
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:57,027
I'll get you, I'll get you, I'll get you.

343
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,037
Flying Toad, go away!

344
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,762
Stop the car. I'm a cop.

345
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:34,898
Granny, bye, bye.

346
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,859
Stop the car!

347
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,629
More than a dozen of them.

348
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,256
What's going on?

349
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,181
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

350
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,308
No, no, peanuts!

351
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,019
Drink peanuts, I'll be safe.

352
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,186
I will keep this a secret.

353
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,772
Why are the two women different?

354
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,276
Saying brown makes you so nervous

355
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,486
If you don't get nervous, you'll fake gasping.

356
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,863
Tell the secret than listen to a bawl

357
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,906
It's more noisy than a man's melon before he's halfway through.

358
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,951
Don't be afraid, don't listen to the bawling

359
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,370
Say it!

360
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,790
Bawling, drilling, stone... yo.

361
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,709
Do it already.

362
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,377
I've been shot, can't you see?

363
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,592
Open a bottle of champagne on the ground. What? Say something.

364
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,972
Hey, it's not safe here. Go to the toilet.

365
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,312
Get the brown, get the blame.

366
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,271
Come on, yo. Say it, smack.

367
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,942
I will wrap the diamond ... I will wrap the peanut to disturb suo jiulong ...

368
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,194
Hey, don't say that.

369
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:02,986
What do you mean?

370
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,822
Don't be afraid, even if you talk.

371
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,033
Oh, I can't hear you anymore.

372
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,328
Hey, he's mute. He didn't even talk about begging. Let's go.

373
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,584
What are you doing?

374
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,919
Maniac!

375
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,464
Unh, unh, unh, unh!

376
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,507
Hey, go through the back door.

377
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,017
It's in!

378
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,399
Hey, there's no one there. Say something.

379
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,067
Bawl, peanut spread...

380
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,028
Noisy, do you find this LIFTT good?

381
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,450
Morning. Right side.

382
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,993
Morning. Left side.

383
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,122
Take care of the back.

384
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,757
Unh-unh, don't be proud, it's a ghost.

385
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,676
You're a ghost!

386
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,597
We are talking about the restoration of the Qing Dynasty.

387
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,890
Shaolin and Saki ask for honesty

388
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,517
The Remains of the Burning of the Red Lotus Monastery, not to be smacked

389
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,560
What? Choke? Well, oh?

390
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,645
That means repeating every word for one more disaster.

391
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,729
You're almost there.

392
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,399
Bawl, bawl, bawl, bawl, bawl, bawl.

393
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,234
Stalls, wiring, nine, nine, nine, nine

394
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,193
You're talking about choking.

395
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,988
Have some peanut butter.

396
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,534
"Well, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

397
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,251
Even a little girl knows how to speak brown, how many silkworms do you have?

398
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,087
Well, there's no one at LIEFT

399
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,048
wait for

400
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,426
Drink, Pei.

401
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:28,840
Black cat, what am I doing?

402
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,302
You have to remember the Un, Mae Sum Phen.

403
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,970
Baa! Mae Wan!

404
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,516
Red Cat, what about you?

405
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,477
I'm not. You saw it all.

406
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,606
I'll sing, and I'll be home for half a day.

407
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,941
Are you okay?

408
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,150
I'm fine, but I don't care about you.

409
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,612
You can't have peanuts.

410
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,114
Don't worry about the red cat, remember

411
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,327
No matter what, Wing Sum is the best photographer in Hong Kong.

412
00:33:59,162 --> 00:33:59,913
Red Cat is stingy ...

413
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,194
I've got the white sock.

414
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,738
No, they are not white socks

415
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,699
White hands and socks, red beard and eyes, ahjumma

416
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,450
I guarantee he's robbing diamonds...

417
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,994
BERT

418
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,161
She doesn't look like a thief

419
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:40,704
Well, it seems.

420
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,456
There is a way. You can try it than me and you'll see.

421
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,000
Lai Lai?

422
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,210
I'm a student in Scotland...

423
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,878
The tweezers have to be used.

424
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,047
But you're gonna work with me, Joe.

425
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,761
I‥I
Sir, please sit down

426
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,557
Don't do it. Sit down. Sit down.

427
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,809
Before my law is consumed

428
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,227
I won't answer any questions.

429
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,563
We're playing an IQ game.

430
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,064
We're waiting for my lawyer to be silenced.

431
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,858
Do you know that I am already in water?

432
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,067
Not allergic to howling

433
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,779
I was studying in America at Scotland Yard.

434
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,782
NO.1 Chinese Bald Detective

435
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,909
You're afraid you've heard my name.

436
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,869
Oh, I've heard the sound.

437
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,120
Our cooperation with forced laughter

438
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,747
But wait for me to speak first.

439
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,247
Dead Man's Bag

440
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,165
Carry a hand and devour it!

441
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,668
I don't want to be stingy with you, you know...

442
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,170
Unh-unh-unh! I have not let go.

443
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,005
Hey, hey, you're so messy!

444
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:32,839
Silence. - Yeah.

445
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:36,801
Silence. - Yeah.

446
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,429
Sir, we are playing games.

447
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,597
Yes!

448
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,391
Let's play a game of reactions.

449
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,810
You carry a hand out and a man pounces on it.

450
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,146
If the opponent wins, he wins on the other side.

451
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,606
Then who is going to do it first?

452
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,733
I'll take your hand.

453
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,200
Oh, you look at me like that.

454
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,955
It's my turn to scream.

455
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,082
Don't play.

456
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,375
Carry a hand out and devour

457
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,296
The side is stingy, it's a sure thing.

458
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,547
Wailing

459
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:15,965
Is it this one?

460
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,717
Drink.

461
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,219
Oh, my God!

462
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,770
Hustle. My turn to howl.

463
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:37,112
Where's my gun, you son of a bitch?

464
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,196
What about the degree?

465
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,159
Drink, don't make me noisy.

466
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,661
What are you doing?

467
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,791
Hey, are you playing?

468
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,042
There is one

469
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,962
I've been playing with it since I was a kid, and I won it.

470
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,171
What's the point?

471
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,506
Let you go.

472
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,050
Come on, forced laughter.

473
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,637
It's so simple. The right hand is holding the ear.

474
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,598
Hold a floor with your left hand, turn, turn, turn five times

475
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,308
Then, they went to the stall to bawl a beer.

476
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,269
If you get it, you win.

477
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,479
I don't think you want to work with me.

478
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,481
No, you show me how to do it. I'll do it first.

479
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,359
It's so easy to be a good boy, just like the song "The Little Brother".

480
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,736
Adopt an ear to live under the ground

481
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,279
Head DUP DUP, tail Eeyi Eeyi

482
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,908
First turn, Chrysanthemum Garden; second turn, Blind Dragon Boat

483
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,537
In the third turn, the back is sore. In the fourth turn, the breath is dull.

484
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,706
Fifth turn, soft feet

485
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,040
Ming?

486
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,500
Ming-Ya, silence!

487
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,795
Hey, turn to the edge first.

488
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,255
Choke, are you really waxing?

489
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,215
Stay with me. - Oh, my God.

490
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,717
Slowly.

491
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,803
I can use the fastener. I'll live with you. What?

492
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,181
Wow, it's so restless, it's on the verge of five circles.

493
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,391
You got it. You got it. I'm on my third one.

494
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,227
The fourth brown, the exorcism, the fifth la?

495
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,438
I'll take a bite. I'll take a bite. I'll take a bite.

496
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,564
Come on.

497
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:59,027
First turn, Chrysanthemum Garden; second turn, Blind Dragon Boat

498
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,698
In the third turn, the back is sore. In the fourth turn, the breath is dull.

499
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,535
The fifth turn, the feet are soft, the sixth turn ....

500
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,579
To Bitterness

501
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,793
Bye. - Bye.

502
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,337
It's really a loss of water.

503
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,881
I've made five turns before.

504
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,592
He has already made a lot of noise and choked.

505
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,011
Take a break.

506
00:38:59,128 --> 00:38:59,712
Item 1 King

507
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,799
I'm a white sock. I want to be with you.

508
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,012
You'll have to wait a while to kill me

509
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,180
What do you mean?

510
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,807
It is because some people are fighting against the clock.

511
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,700
Un, big brother, stop! Stop!

512
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,876
Damn pretty boy, you'd better go, I'll go home to work

513
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,127
Class Ma?

514
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,552
It's her coffee, mention her

515
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,961
Un call the superintendent, he's holding the door open and howling.

516
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,756
Okay, step two.

517
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:25,840
know

518
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,772
Someone has hit me.

519
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,525
You're wrong, you're wrong. I'm a white knight.

520
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,279
I have a gift for you. Go to the door.

521
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,411
What? Choke on it?

522
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,288
Wings, what are the means?

523
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,833
The same bawling method of selling diamonds is exactly the same as the noise

524
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,123
Chan Pak Cheung, it's your turn for forced laughter

525
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,553
No, I'll do it.

526
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,806
You can't get out.

527
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,349
Go straight out!

528
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,521
Look behind you.

529
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,279
If you're not with me, you're dead today.

530
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,739
Thank you for saving my life.

531
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,074
You are reporting to me?

532
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,826
And when I, the lawyer, have been devoured, I shall speak of the blame.

533
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:47,041
Hey, hey, hey... you save me from the silence.

534
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,335
I've been looking into the diamond bawling case lately.

535
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,461
It's not me.

536
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,046
Then I'm looking for the wrong person.

537
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,591
Un, 吽, 係吝, 係吝, 我謳啡, 我謳咎

538
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,926
It's me doing the noise, it's me doing the sh...

539
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,928
What about the diamonds?

540
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,096
I don't know.

541
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,723
You don't want to click me, my hands are soft

542
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,892
Noisy, don't be so soft, I'll at most talk about devouring

543
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,894
So, what's the edge of the diamond?

544
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,020
Red Cat, collect the ball!

545
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,063
Where are the red cats?

546
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,314
She is so noisy

547
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,691
You've been chasing me again.

548
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:12,775
Hey, Lah, come on.

549
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,735
At most, I'll let you get a bag of diamonds.

550
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,113
Yes, after the bunting of the diamonds

551
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,198
I want you to help me with the white socks, Joe.

552
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,325
Okay, no. You have to promise me one thing.

553
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,493
What is it?

554
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,828
Afterwards, don't tell me the noise.

555
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,788
I'll make sure you're okay.

556
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,206
How can you guarantee that?

557
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,332
I swear.

558
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,884
Bomb ready?

559
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,801
Net ready.

560
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,011
Take it up.

561
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,220
What are you listening to?

562
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,680
Oh, it's so tight in the morning.

563
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,056
You send a side up there?

564
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,141
carnation

565
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,934
It is noisy!

566
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,396
Oh, you relax. It's hot, it's not loud.

567
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,358
What is the place?

568
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,277
I can't stay for one more minute to sneeze.

569
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,529
What are you talking about?

570
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,156
It's a big deal!

571
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,700
Eat! You've got it, carbonic acid.

572
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,994
The lack of color, aroma and flavor is really disgusting.

573
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,162
You son of a bitch!

574
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,788
Look at this lamb-head, he lacks upbringing

575
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,917
It is disgusting to ask me to live in the same room with them.

576
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,588
Yes, the air is dirty.

577
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,132
The lack of air is simply a source of indifference.

578
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,558
Noisy, you can't make a sound even if she dies

579
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,185
The bomb site?

580
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,436
Go on, yawn. Go make noise.

581
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,773
Even the sound of the doorbell is too loud.

582
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,192
Do it already.

583
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,443
I'm sending shoes, Joe.

584
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,445
It's my sister.

585
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,279
Put it down!

586
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,072
[Jus

587
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,078
I can't be coy about this.

588
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,413
And you two are working together.

589
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,623
Gimmick my house.

590
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:58,965
You. Okay.

591
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,007
You. Okay.

592
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,717
What about me?

593
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,552
I'm all right.

594
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,724
Sister, what are you doing? Don't insult her!

595
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,851
She has red eyes.

596
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,072
Sister, which one of these two is silent?

597
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,740
Well, wait for me.

598
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,909
This one, you don't know anything about it

599
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,495
This one, there's no need to use the coffee.

600
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:33,582
Sit.

601
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,711
Hey! Hey, do you want to have a brownie?

602
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,920
Unh! Let's go! Let's go!

603
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,381
Don't breathe, sit down for a while and go first

604
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,723
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

605
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:50,808
You're going to Japan?

606
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:51,934
evade

607
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,144
Do business.

608
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,104
No, it's the world.

609
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,397
Hey!

610
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,816
You don't see it, do you?

611
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:02,403
It's like a pretty boy has been hit by a head drop when he sees your girl

612
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,239
Now she doesn't even know that you're begging for old beans

613
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,699
Well, you old bean, what are you doing?

614
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,117
I don't even know.

615
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,577
Did you steal the diamond?

616
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,078
It's me. Steal it, Joe.

617
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,621
Collect the burying and swallowing edge.

618
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,332
Red Cat Buried

619
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,958
Mr. Kwong, do you know what you are looking for?

620
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,670
She wrote the secret on these two women.

621
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,589
The two girls are so dark that they can't be seen.

622
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,673
There... you.

623
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:26,052
I have found two daughters in my previous life.

624
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,348
Hey, bald guy, you heard me.

625
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,225
I've said that the only thing I've done is to steal coffee from this pretty boy.

626
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,810
Do you have me?

627
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,270
What about you?

628
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,065
I'm just a skinhead. I'm the same.

629
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,191
Not even you.

630
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,776
Noisy, you have caught my hand.

631
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,944
What are you doing, men?

632
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,322
You hear that smack?

633
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,699
Only this pretty boy knows that diamonds are sold.

634
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,284
I, for my part, give the order.

635
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,870
I'm not sure if I'll be able to get a diamond before I get a diamond.

636
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,373
Keep her safe and sound.

637
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,832
Shit, Achanla's feet of bombs went up and howled.

638
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,667
What are you talking about?

639
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,460
Well!

640
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,545
Achang, go up to the stall and drop a bomb.

641
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,798
Don't have enough time to howl

642
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:04,673
Point.

643
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,467
There is enough time to get on, not enough time to get off.

644
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,596
I don't care. In any case, I don't want to pay you to blow him up.

645
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,307
Noisy, are you still here?

646
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,852
I'll go, you see!

647
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,858
It's airy and refreshing, and your head is bare.

648
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,654
Oh, yo, the steak's pretty again, but your sister's a bitch.

649
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:27,947
What are you choking on?

650
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,573
Goo, yo, yo, yo, yo.

651
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,659
Even the doorbell sounds good.

652
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,577
I can open the door with a bang.

653
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:34,954
Wrong delivery!

654
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,455
Wrong delivery, you're a worm.

655
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,875
A shoebox is heavy, don't worry about it.

656
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,883
You, big guy, Joe.

657
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,771
What is the name and phone number of the woman who watched the incident?

658
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,400
This is the work of a specialist in the field. I hope he will remember it.

659
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,487
Hey, Sok-an To, shoot the hard file and then help me with the earnest.

660
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,823
Recently, Hao Suo has been making a lot of noise.

661
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,868
I'm crying. It's not a girl's name, it's a phone forced laughter.

662
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,079
She's all over the place. I don't remember that much.

663
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,457
Has she encountered any girls recently?

664
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,293
Yes, two Tims

665
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,921
But it's so outrageous that I have to pick them.

666
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,633
What kind of mouth do you like to kiss? You should remember that.

667
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,677
If everyone can remember

668
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,054
Then I don't need a computer.

669
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,811
No! And the family is happy to have a cup and less noise

670
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,521
The diamond shouting opportunity is not so good again.

671
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,064
You're going to be in the brownies again, yo.

672
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,149
You and me, yo.

673
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,526
If you shrink, you'll be happy, but it's hard to snap.

674
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,360
Relationship

675
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,445
What about when Shi Shui-sheung was about to die?

676
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,905
A big belch.

677
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,490
I suspect he may have a girl friend.

678
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,574
It's called "Rose".

679
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,408
Precedent

680
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,786
What's the matter with you?

681
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,662
Relationship.

682
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,124
Then, you must help me to take a picture.

683
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,000
Point.

684
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,418
It is because where a person has been introduced and shouted at

685
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,836
I've been asked to shadow shop

686
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,129
Photo Gallery Remembrance Noise

687
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,465
Well, the oral water....

688
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,841
Don't use it, don't use it, don't use it.

689
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,468
It's all right.

690
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,721
Rose Sam?

691
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,392
Madam, we don't have a relationship with each other.

692
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,646
Beer, not a shadow.

693
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,774
I'm so sorry.

694
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,401
I'd like to share a date with a friend.

695
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:30,778
The edge.

696
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,155
Has anyone had a nude photo shoot lately?

697
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,366
Rowan?

698
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,494
So you're a friend of Rowan Brown?

699
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,829
No, I'm a friend of the Fountain of Lips.

700
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,249
Don't you know you're a beggar, country bumpkin?

701
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,834
This is the phone number of a girl who has a full body.

702
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,086
I don't know what she's whining about all day.

703
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,254
Take a sip of water.

704
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,006
Oh, I know. A red cat?

705
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:51,882
That's right.

706
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,636
Drink up, you poor bastard! I'm sorry, but I've never seen anything.

707
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,888
Drink, yo. It's good for me.

708
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,182
No, I don't even know where the spasticity is

709
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,101
I don't want to make any noise.

710
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:02,851
I recommend you to help me...

711
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,896
Well, when I'm quiet, you go keep the door open.

712
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,481
If there's a gag, it's a gag.

713
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,362
You're dead, smack.

714
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,082
Hey, what are you doing?

715
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,125
Tablet 0

716
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,253
I've got a husband yelling.

717
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,297
Nothing

718
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:32,756
I'm so old. Shh. Brown.

719
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,675
Mmm, high. Okay.

720
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,926
I'm not pretty again

721
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,511
Yes.

722
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,228
What is it?

723
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,316
She doesn't recognize my style of forced laughter.

724
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,528
You're wearing one, don't you think she looks like you?

725
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,571
Don't do it.

726
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:09,001
I'll give you a chance to have a relationship with me at most.

727
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,840
Enough.

728
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,774
But Ding! Both of them.

729
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,069
I've got the blame.

730
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,737
The first girl asked suo to do this.

731
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,238
For a while, I'll be the one to talk about Jin.

732
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:38,822
What do you mean?

733
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,699
First of all, Grandpa, you take care of me.

734
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,285
Is this a girl from a later age? Is she looking at me?

735
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:44,620
That's not necessary.

736
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,413
I've been in Chinatown before.

737
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,998
The most glamorous brown men's election howl

738
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:48,749
Result

739
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,292
I have to.

740
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,126
How many people have participated in the event?

741
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,294
Well, I'll take one.

742
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,047
For a while, I talked about the blame.

743
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,800
I'm not a lawyer, I'm a lawyer.

744
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,134
I'm the one who's going to tell the story.

745
00:52:59,301 --> 00:52:59,843
Heh !

746
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:00,844
Whoo !

747
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,058
What have you done?

748
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:07,768
Oh, okay, time for coffee.

749
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,021
What are you doing first?

750
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,149
He hit me on the waist and hit me on the head.

751
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,236
I've been talking about Jin for a while, don't make a sound

752
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,612
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

753
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:19,530
Wait for me to tell the story.

754
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,322
I want to talk.

755
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,073
Long Village

756
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:21,990
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

757
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,035
Traffic vehicle hitting traffic light at entrance of the Kowloon Motorway

758
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,578
The traffic is really bad.

759
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,417
Hey, taxi service station, you know?

760
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,045
93, the old lady asked you if you were going to eat at the house.

761
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,214
If you know my wife, I won't be able to get to her at any time.

762
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,507
Mary, I'm asking you to have dinner.

763
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,426
Good, but don't be idle this morning

764
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,803
A MARY, Sister Un, EI

765
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:43,721
Who are you?

766
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,055
I'm a barrister.

767
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,598
This is him, Uncle Yuen Wong.

768
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:47,725
A woman

769
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,186
The water phase is so full of claws

770
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,021
I don't know where she died.

771
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,607
You've killed him!

772
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:57,901
She's really dead!

773
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,361
But go to hell. Go to the side. We don't know.

774
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,154
What a sigh!

775
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,740
Unh! He died a horrible death!

776
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,907
When he was dying of brown

777
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,535
Mr. Go, tell him your name.

778
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,415
She called me by my name even before she died.

779
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,585
H 炎 ‧ IE

780
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,216
There is a man who doesn't want to see Nezha.

781
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,720
Please inform the taxi service counter at the side.

782
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,223
Mr CHAN, this girl really has [sympathy].

783
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:33,437
Blessed be God... bawling a northern dog

784
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,522
He has an inheritance.

785
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,108
How many of them are left behind?

786
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,235
Into 500,000 Joe

787
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,445
Howl for money!

788
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:46,742
Wow, hello. Oh, what a surprise.

789
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:49,578
A dog from the north is making money

790
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,705
Thank you, God. Thank you. [Diao Shuihao

791
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:56,251
The grandfather is stingy, and the God of Heaven has choked and devoured him.

792
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,633
You've got no place to go, Petain.

793
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,967
Oh, thank you.

794
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,178
However, it is not yet processed in Hong Kong.

795
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,305
We must first prove your identity.

796
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,681
Oh, come on, I have an identity card. Listen.

797
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,433
Oh, no! I would like to share with you, please...

798
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,852
The body is so special.

799
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,980
You're a bastard, and you're even talking about it.

800
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,315
I'm bawling. I'm drunk. What?

801
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,943
Oh, beg you to drink.

802
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,613
"Noisy, know how to eat, chirp, and relationship.

803
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,825
A fire truck is available at the Dry Point Fire Station.

804
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,492
Chung Yes

805
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,702
Hong Kong colonies have been drinking from coffin trolleys and carts of dead people.

806
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,829
It's so annoying.

807
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,206
Your land is ridiculous.

808
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,625
Parrot wants to see my sister's ass!

809
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,878
Wow, look at the 500 000 howls!

810
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,383
I can't even see 500,000 if I look at it

811
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,801
You've made it!

812
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,145
If you don't pay your salary, your eyes will be in the right place.

813
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,148
Oh, so the estate is automatically transferred to pay him.

814
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,316
Ah Wong Tenant Throat Hustle

815
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,112
Un, then you have begged and choked to prove that he is his core?

816
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,491
I love Fortuna

817
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,411
Where do we go?

818
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,291
The Government should drink at this level, so that it can show its own face to itself.

819
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,835
Then, don't be afraid to say "yes" for the sake of love.

820
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,045
Unh-unh... good meat and sour shout.

821
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,714
Half a million questions...

822
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,382
I don't have any silver.

823
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,593
I've got it, girl.

824
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,057
Hey, don't allow me to repeat it

825
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,934
Remember...

826
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,478
It's not a face, it's a memo

827
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,072
Hey, she's with a female film student

828
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,199
Go and visit a Hong Kong girl.

829
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,255
Brother

830
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,304
Mr. Hustle is happy to see you.

831
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,223
That's right. Bye.

832
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,725
Hey, Mickey, live.

833
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,271
Two of them.

834
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:35,118
Wow, Brother Sing, Puru.

835
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,501
Is it your own water?

836
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,712
He's just a maniac.

837
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,048
I don't even want to see her sigh.

838
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,179
The two dwellings are in their own water.

839
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,017
It's an accident.

840
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,355
I'm not even prepared!

841
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,150
Noisy, bad environment, howling

842
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,946
Don't worry, we have two brothers in the world.

843
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,823
You're not as loud as I am, are you?

844
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,786
Hey, I don't know who's in this place, but I'm a madman.

845
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,290
You're bold enough to be on the edge, but I'm a nude girl.

846
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,167
What is the edge of the sale offer?

847
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,837
Hey, one person is dead.

848
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,547
Two of them can fight for serious injuries.

849
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,048
Shoot the hard file and spit it out!

850
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,633
Oh, nothing.

851
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,886
Tell me, which one is the vendor?

852
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,847
Two persons

853
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,807
The bridge is on the other side.

854
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,976
Come on out, lace!

855
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,562
Which one is it? Ask my sister to take a picture first.

856
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,188
齊 齊 開 [ 刁

857
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:46,523
Yes.

858
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,316
Both of them.

859
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,110
What a choke!

860
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,404
Both of them.

861
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,374
What is the noise, and what is the home?

862
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,376
Don't be proud of it.

863
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,337
Which one is it?

864
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,132
Un, it's me for a while.

865
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,012
What a pain in the ass!

866
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,056
Do you have a copy?

867
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,348
Proverbially, yo, live and let live.

868
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,434
He lied and howled first

869
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,645
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

870
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,022
Don't be afraid of the noise.

871
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,274
I'm going to let you go if I can.

872
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,530
Hey, yo, it's my turn to scream.

873
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,240
My nose is not big enough for you.

874
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,366
I have to shake a lot.

875
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,701
Jo, yo, yo, yo.

876
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,411
Oh, I'm on it.

877
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:48,251
I really don't want to go up there again.

878
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,046
Noisy, it's my turn to be brown, I'm so sheepish.

879
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,798
You call me Chee.

880
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,382
Chee.

881
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,259
Un, Yegor devour!

882
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:00,388
"I'm going to get a new one," he said.

883
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,348
Imitation of the Seventh Day of the Year (Quat 7)

884
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,225
How much more do you have to shake, apparently?

885
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:04,351
You son of a bitch!

886
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,020
Let me fall, you want to kill me?

887
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,818
Un, don't let me go. I'm dead. I'm dead.

888
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,533
But you didn't die until the noise.

889
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:21,910
You're dead. I'm not dead.

890
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,454
If I don't talk like that, why would you let me go?

891
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,832
All right, drink up. My turn, yo.

892
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,417
I'm going to shake it, Ben.

893
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,419
You are not angry!

894
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,256
You're all crazy, and you talk about righteousness and shivering!

895
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,383
You bald-headed bastard, you told me to move first.

896
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,218
In fact, it's all your fault.

897
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,346
So you sigh.

898
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,437
No bites, no brownies, including a few more knives.

899
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,773
You're a deadbeat. You want to lend me a knife.

900
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,818
Fat nephew, you actually want your sister to take a picture of her.

901
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,613
Oh, my God, Sing is not even calling.

902
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,407
Call Fatty, Brother Sing.

903
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,492
I'll call him Fatty

904
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,953
It's better than calling him a tortoise star behind your back.

905
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,787
What are you choking on?

906
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,507
You bastard, if you want to shake, you can do it.

907
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,218
♪ Choke, you and I will smack ♪

908
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,929
I am most familiar with this place, no trains.

909
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,055
No trains.

910
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,979
Ah! No fire engine!

911
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,857
"You'll have to be like this on all sides of the earth.

912
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,061
It's so trivial to ask for hospitalization.

913
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,438
We have to designate the same layer.

914
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,191
I've been so stingy, I've blocked a ball from turning.

915
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,194
If you're choking on something, just keep calling me.

916
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,863
All right.

917
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,246
Rising Sun I

918
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,915
You need to assume that I am not there.

919
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,585
I'm going out for a choke.

920
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,093
Ha ha!

921
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,594
I have a chance with Doraemon.

922
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,971
You're not in good hands with the poor lady.

923
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,973
I don't think so. I don't want to yell at her.

924
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,309
It's no use yelling at him. He's so pathetic.

925
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,269
What about the two dead guys?

926
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,313
Choke, grieve 3
"The wicked, the silent, the smack.

927
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,024
Don't go, I want you to help me.

928
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,608
You need a dead man!

929
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,278
I can't believe they dumped me and went to check on Hsuan.

930
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,155
I'm going to make a mess of it.

931
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,616
Koo, begging, you can't say that Ho Tung-sze is a wicked woman.

932
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:52,704
He's my dream lover. He's evil, of course.

933
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,290
But it's all about women's coffee.

934
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,792
Why can't you see her gentle and whispery side?

935
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,879
I am not sure if you know, but I am following him.

936
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,881
She's a grandma who sneezes.

937
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,800
You see brown, when did I cross my waist on the ground?

938
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,970
She didn't bother me half a word.

939
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:13,058
What's the point of being a steel charity show?

940
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,355
She sits low, just like a little girl howling

941
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,482
Never bridge a leg, Joe.

942
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,983
She's good.

943
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,569
Don't you believe it? Wait for it to go silent. You sing it.

944
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,573
B Working day

945
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:31,785
When did you get into the noise and devour Joe?

946
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,956
Oh, don't you want to parry? I want to tell you...

947
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:37,832
Say it.

948
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,668
Listen to my birthday.

949
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,928
Ha, ha, ha, you lose me.

950
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,763
You're in it again.

951
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,848
Do I have a shirt?

952
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,773
What? Choke on it?

953
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,366
I, Auntie

954
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,707
Bite, my sister has done it.

955
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,584
I've never seen her like this before.

956
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:26,923
She's not bothered

957
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,135
You'd better book a bed with him at the nunnery.

958
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,431
Hello, ma'am.

959
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,727
Your sister is on the phone.

960
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,605
A ton, but dang.

961
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,734
Well, I'm on the phone outside.

962
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:55,285
Item 1 King

963
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,662
Grandma, I am Snake Ming

964
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,123
Damn you, you snake!

965
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,624
I told you to check the maniacs.

966
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,168
You and your family have to call me first.

967
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,627
He's still a hard man.

968
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,754
You'll have to give her a break.

969
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:07,714
What?

970
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,925
He wants to be a bald man, you can talk to me and pay him

971
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,553
If he is not a nephew, I will be his nephew

972
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,306
Yes, if I knew you were interested in me

973
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,807
I'll hit you!

974
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,107

01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,587
Exhort, when Shi Shui-sheng is dying?

1136
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:43,088
Sung Il Keung Tun Nine Dragons Phen

1137
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,591
So I'll show you a map of Kowloon Brown.

1138
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:55,642
Second row P6, PD 6

1139
01:20:58,771 --> 01:20:59,480
Relationship with the sea

1140
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,314
That's right!

1141
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:03,442
So, the final line of sale of B3 has been choked to silence.

1142
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,526
What? Unh!

1143
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,071
You're not even a noise.

1144
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:12,117
I'm looking for a throat, B3.

1145
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,160
Bag of tricks!

1146
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,121
Oh, you have a brain, Soo-ho.

1147
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,830
Not as much as you.

1148
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:19,249
Hey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1149
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,167
Drink.

1150
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:23,921
No, I don't know how to swim, Joe.

1151
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:24,797
I'm all right.

1152
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,632
I'm with you.

1153
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:29,718
So, what do you think?

1154
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,178
You're a national traitor!

1155
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,358
I got it.

1156
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,125
I'll get you, I'll get you.

1157
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,794
Don't give it back, it's a fake drink, what's the real deal?

1158
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,504
Ah! Oh, my God.

1159
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,223
Bald Head!

1160
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,066
I'm not going to do anything.

1161
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:26,984
I'm not guilty!

1162
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:27,734
Oh, come on.

1163
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,028
Have you come to do it again?

1164
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:32,239
Do you want to be paid for my stall?

1165
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:33,615
Come on, you're leaving.

1166
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,659
White knuckle socks.

1167
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:36,743
Then we won't have to show up.

1168
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,245
Then you can call me if you need anything.

1169
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,122
I'll bury a thousand horses and help you with your noise.

1170
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:41,874
Come on, let's go.

1171
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,292
The way to the more regular water salary I gradually

friends

1173
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:51,425
Alberg, wear a shirt.

1174
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:56,430
If you are lazy and kind, email me for smuggling, CHHECEK I will really

1175
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:02,644
Hey, Mangalam!

1176
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:03,854
White... - Oh, come on.

1177
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,661
You've set up a network.

1178
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:20,746
Tell me about the Un Un.

1179
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,581
You can't leak the truth.

1180
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,625
It's either you die or they die today.

1181
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:25,667
Then what about you?

1182
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,294
I'm not going to hold your two dots.

1183
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,973
Un, a hundred hands, a hundred socks, a hundred yards, a hundred breaths.

1184
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,079
It's more of a disaster than your death today.

1185
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,584
No noise, need a howl for it

1186
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,545
You're lucky to have a chance.

1187
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:10,504
Then what about you?

1188
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:12,839
Unh, I'll stay quiet for the big show.

1189
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:13,507
Drought III

1190
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,863
You'll get a lot of brown.

1191
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,824
Oh, Jin, it's all over!

1192
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,534
I don't want to call a thousand horses a gag.

1193
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:41,827
What? Choke on a thousand cars and horses?

1194
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,245
Call Montreal for the booth caller

1195
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,246
I'm covering up.

1196

Same as

1197
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,165
But you've laid down a web of heaven and earth again.

1198
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,875
I don't think so.

1200
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,245
Ah, Theo, no, no. You want to die?

1201
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:27,664
Wait for me to be silent. Wait for me to be called!

1202
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,251
Whistle, hey, look at the Un, blindly listen.

1203
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,380
Stop! Unh! Wait for me to devour!

1204
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:41,470
Stop the Un, Stop the Un, Stop the Un, Pour the Un, Pour the Un

1205
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:47,267
A surrender, he surrenders, he surrenders!

1206
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,821
You don't have to use the noise.

1207
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,991
I am like a car, but I have the advantage but not the reality.

1208
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,702

I'm fine.
