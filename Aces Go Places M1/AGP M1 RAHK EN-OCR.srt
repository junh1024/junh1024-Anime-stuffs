1
00:03:27,499 --> 00:03:28,166
Thank you

2
00:03:31,795 --> 00:03:34,047
Oh my, a grenade!

3
00:04:05,036 --> 00:04:05,912
Bye-bye

4
00:04:19,885 --> 00:04:20,969
I'm sorry, the lift's out of order

5
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:24,055
Sorry. Bye-bye

6
00:04:26,892 --> 00:04:27,559
Don't move!

7
00:04:37,235 --> 00:04:44,159
Over there! Hurry! Where is he? Over there!

8
00:04:53,418 --> 00:04:54,377
Aren't you through with it yet?

9
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:56,296
I'm tuning the engine...

10
00:04:56,463 --> 00:04:58,590
Eh, no no... fixing the steering wheel

11
00:05:01,927 --> 00:05:03,220
Now your car's going to be hot,

12
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:04,763
hotter than Indian curry

13
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,688
If I didn't promise your late father
I'd look after you,

14
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,648
I'd have thrown you into the ocean

15
00:05:14,815 --> 00:05:15,357
I'm sorry

16
00:05:15,524 --> 00:05:16,441
Now what's next?

17
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:17,067
Airplane

18
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:17,734
What?

19
00:05:17,901 --> 00:05:18,777
A pleasure boat

20
00:05:18,944 --> 00:05:19,611
What?

21
00:05:19,778 --> 00:05:21,905
Oh no, flying a kite

22
00:05:22,155 --> 00:05:23,031
Then get on with it!

23
00:05:24,533 --> 00:05:26,284
Yes, to fly a kite, fly a kite

24
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,369
Get on with it!

25
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:48,390
Bye-bye

26
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:27,484
Hello Roberto

27
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,070
Hello, Monty, long time no see

28
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,530
Hello Monty, had a nice time in Hong Kong?

29
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:33,239
No!

30
00:09:33,364 --> 00:09:34,699
Godfather's not happy

31
00:09:34,866 --> 00:09:35,450
Me too

32
00:09:35,617 --> 00:09:37,494
He's waiting for you, good luck, Monty boy

33
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,620
Gracia, Gracia

34
00:09:48,129 --> 00:09:49,255
Don Antonio

35
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:53,218
Go find your mama, baby Monty my son

36
00:09:58,723 --> 00:10:00,558
Don Antonio, I'm sorry

37
00:10:02,102 --> 00:10:06,648
You're sorry, what's the matter with you?
Ah? What's the matter with you?

38
00:10:07,524 --> 00:10:08,441
Don Antonio

39
00:10:08,608 --> 00:10:13,696
Every time you make a mistake you come back
to me & give me a lot of bullshit,

40
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,950
now tell me who did it?

41
00:10:18,743 --> 00:10:19,911
White gloves

42
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,250
Is him? Where is he now?

43
00:10:25,667 --> 00:10:26,543
He's in Venice

44
00:10:37,095 --> 00:10:39,430
So I believe you my boy

45
00:10:40,098 --> 00:10:42,100
I never lie to you Godfather

46
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:46,896
But now, you go to Hong Kong
and get me the diamonds

47
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:48,481
Why me?

48
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,319
You do as I say, or you'll be dead fish

49
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:56,406
You can use my connectionsin Hong Kong

50
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:58,616
I can lose the diamonds

51
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,370
but I cannot lose Italian's face, Capice!

52
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,788
But I'm British!

53
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,123
Stupid

54
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:10,503
You still don't know British
and Italians are cousins

55
00:11:10,753 --> 00:11:12,130
I've never heard of it

56
00:11:13,464 --> 00:11:15,008
Diamonds or your life!

57
00:11:35,987 --> 00:11:38,656
Sir, according to our investigation...

58
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:43,077
Hold it, you don't have to speak
English to foreigners,

59
00:11:43,244 --> 00:11:44,621
you can speak Chinese

60
00:11:45,121 --> 00:11:46,623
Hua, you carry on

61
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:48,958
A robbery has recently taken place
in Tsimshatsui Centre

62
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:51,169
An invaluable consignment of diamonds

63
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:54,380
was stolen and strangely enough,

64
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,174
the case was not reported

65
00:11:56,758 --> 00:11:58,676
Let's have a look at the
information we've gathered

66
00:12:07,769 --> 00:12:10,271
This is Szeto Bud-yen,

67
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:13,733
a local gangster who deals in loot

68
00:12:15,818 --> 00:12:19,781
This is an up-and-coming leader of
an international smuggling syndicate,

69
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:22,867
and Italian by the name of Monterosso

70
00:12:23,201 --> 00:12:24,786
In this robbery,

71
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:27,789
Szeto didn't suffer any losses,

72
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,043
and the Italian hadn't made a report either

73
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:35,505
The only clue that's left at the scene

74
00:12:36,047 --> 00:12:37,757
was a white glove

75
00:12:38,299 --> 00:12:42,553
We have no further information I complete blank

76
00:12:43,721 --> 00:12:45,974
The above information is furnished

77
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,892
by our informer Squealie

78
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:49,894
Because of the extraordinary status of his identity

79
00:12:50,061 --> 00:12:52,522
we cannot disclose his name

80
00:12:52,689 --> 00:12:54,232
We all know him, it's Ming the Muddlehead

81
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,568
Quiet, don't ruin the atmosphere

82
00:12:57,944 --> 00:13:01,072
This is the world's most
renowned burglar White Glove

83
00:13:01,406 --> 00:13:04,993
He specializes in diamonds and gold,

84
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:10,290
has 7 passports, 8 names, 9 identities

85
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:12,458
and 2 sexes

86
00:13:13,376 --> 00:13:15,712
That he has this time graced our city

87
00:13:16,004 --> 00:13:18,756
with his presence is indeed our honour,

88
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:22,552
but at the same time our misfortune

89
00:13:23,553 --> 00:13:25,596
So we must get in touch

90
00:13:25,847 --> 00:13:27,682
with his arch enemies and enlist their help

91
00:13:27,849 --> 00:13:29,183
Arch enemies?

92
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:32,478
Yes, he has two of them

93
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:35,940
The first is Peter Sellers, the Pink Panther

94
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,484
but the Lord has called him to His side

95
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:41,279
The second is...

96
00:13:41,446 --> 00:13:42,697
Hey, get out of the way!

97
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,283
The super sleuth from the USA, Kodojak

98
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:46,909
Because of White Glove,

99
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:49,871
he was demoted from a single/single/flush
to a no letter/no flower,

100
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:52,290
from a sergeant to a constable

101
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:56,002
And his superiors have told him that

102
00:13:56,169 --> 00:13:57,670
if he didn't capture White Glove
in three months' time

103
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:01,716
he could draw his pension,
go back to his home town and wash dishes

104
00:14:04,135 --> 00:14:07,555
And so we decide to bring Kodojak here

105
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:10,975
because he is most keen on getting White Glove

106
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:15,229
We'll also be assigning this year's
Most Outstanding Youth Award winner,

107
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,773
our lady superintendent Ho Tung-see

108
00:14:16,939 --> 00:14:18,483
Ah, that shrew!

109
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:19,817
To assist Kodojak

110
00:14:19,984 --> 00:14:22,862
in this case

111
00:14:23,029 --> 00:14:24,655
Excellent ideal

112
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,247
Hey buddy, you got a light?

113
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,003
Wow, it's a babe!

114
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,005
Come on baby, light my fire

115
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:42,548
Yeah but her outfit's a bit conservative

116
00:14:44,842 --> 00:14:46,677
Don't let appearances deceive you

117
00:14:49,430 --> 00:14:50,556
So you guys wanna look?

118
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:51,808
Sure!

119
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:54,685
Now don't blink!

120
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:59,857
So you want a light, eh?

121
00:15:00,024 --> 00:15:01,567
Don't drive me mad or my gun's gonna discharge

122
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,945
It's all his fault, I got nothing to do with it

123
00:15:04,112 --> 00:15:05,113
We won't do it again, ma'am

124
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:09,367
Let's go. It's all your fault!

125
00:15:09,534 --> 00:15:09,909
You say it's my fault?

126
00:15:10,076 --> 00:15:10,868
Why didn't you bring a light

127
00:15:11,035 --> 00:15:12,078
along with your cigarettes?

128
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:12,829
Come on, let's go out of here

129
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,293
What're you looking at?
Ain't never seen a woman's legs?

130
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,087
No, I'm just admiring your holster

131
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:23,923
Superintendent Ho, are you here to meet Kodojak?

132
00:15:24,257 --> 00:15:25,466
I ain't got time for that

133
00:15:25,633 --> 00:15:27,218
I come here to look for Squealie

134
00:15:27,385 --> 00:15:29,512
How're you going find him in this crowd?

135
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,348
Don't you worry about that

136
00:15:32,515 --> 00:15:33,724
He's surface when I shout

137
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:35,601
Squealie!

138
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,019
Not here!

139
00:15:37,311 --> 00:15:38,771
Now hold it right there!

140
00:15:39,647 --> 00:15:41,107
Gotta run!

141
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:42,984
Hold it!

142
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,644
Come on down here

143
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:24,692
There's no one around now, don't take it so seriously

144
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:28,946
I'm covering you up. What've got for me?

145
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:32,450
3 clues, two are good and the other's bad

146
00:16:33,951 --> 00:16:35,661
Let's hear the good ones

147
00:16:37,288 --> 00:16:39,957
The good ones are:
Baldy is arriving from the States today

148
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:41,834
and you've been assigned to work with him

149
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,419
How did you get to know our top secret?

150
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,796
I'm an informer

151
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,298
And then?

152
00:16:47,757 --> 00:16:48,674
And then there's going to be a robbery

153
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,052
at the Chow Tai Fok Jewellery in Kowloon City

154
00:16:51,219 --> 00:16:52,303
How do you know it's today?

155
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:53,888
I picked the day for them

156
00:16:54,805 --> 00:16:56,557
What? Is today a good day?

157
00:16:58,643 --> 00:16:59,936
No, it's a lousy day

158
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,314
And what about the bad one?

159
00:17:04,273 --> 00:17:04,732
The bad one

160
00:17:04,899 --> 00:17:06,776
is your superiors said you
wouldn't be at the airport today

161
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,945
and told me to do my rounds here

162
00:17:09,111 --> 00:17:10,780
And I have to run into you

163
00:17:10,947 --> 00:17:11,697
What rotten luck!

164
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,450
Rotten luck, eh?

165
00:17:17,245 --> 00:17:17,870
The plane has landed

166
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,082
Yes, the plane has landed. Go wait for him,
I got to go work on a case

167
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:21,958
What case?

168
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:24,544
None of your business. Anyway it's hot

169
00:17:42,311 --> 00:17:43,854
- Wind against Water,
- Snow against Wind,

170
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:45,022
White against Red,

171
00:17:45,189 --> 00:17:46,607
- Four Great Happiness,
- Young husband,

172
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,610
- Losing is tough,
- Winning is fun

173
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,696
I'm Benny Chan

174
00:17:52,154 --> 00:17:53,531
I'm Albert Au

175
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,367
That's my cover name

176
00:17:57,368 --> 00:17:58,369
Same here

177
00:18:09,171 --> 00:18:10,298
Hey boss,

178
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,925
someone's gonna hold you up in a minute

179
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:15,720
Don't get alarmed, I'm here

180
00:18:15,886 --> 00:18:18,139
Nobody moves, it's a hold up, Get away from here

181
00:18:18,306 --> 00:18:22,393
Don't move, What're you try to do? Lie down here!

182
00:18:25,021 --> 00:18:27,064
Everybody stand against the corner, get moving!

183
00:18:28,399 --> 00:18:30,234
Get a move on and fill it up!

184
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,945
What're you looking at? Turn your face away!

185
00:18:34,405 --> 00:18:35,364
Attention all units,

186
00:18:35,573 --> 00:18:38,117
alarm at the Chow Tai Fok Jewellery in Kowloon City

187
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,952
Check out the situation

188
00:18:41,287 --> 00:18:42,413
Where's the Chow Tai Fok Jewellery?

189
00:18:42,580 --> 00:18:43,539
Just around the corner,

190
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:44,665
Let's go then

191
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,084
We're all set, chief

192
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:49,128
Good. Go get a car. Don't move

193
00:18:55,718 --> 00:18:59,972
Don't move. Get back in there,
or I'll blow your brains off

194
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:03,809
Don't move

195
00:19:04,602 --> 00:19:05,478
We're ready, chief

196
00:19:05,645 --> 00:19:07,063
Don't come after us

197
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:12,276
Let's get going

198
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:25,623
Get out, the Royal Hong Kong police
now requisitions your car

199
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:33,130
Where's the key?

200
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,132
Right here... Ha ha ha!

201
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:40,888
- Be quick
- Drive fast

202
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:43,516
It's hard to be slow but it's easy to be fast

203
00:20:00,074 --> 00:20:00,866
- What are you doing?
- To hell

204
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:01,867
Do you want to send us to hospital?

205
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,577
I'll shoot you. Watch out!

206
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:04,829
Drive

207
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:13,379
Do you know how to drive, Baldhead?

208
00:20:13,546 --> 00:20:15,005
It's just an accident

209
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,632
Just drive, hurry up

210
00:20:23,264 --> 00:20:24,974
Shit, do you know how to drive?

211
00:21:14,523 --> 00:21:16,901
Come down, cop is here

212
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,905
I'm a cop in USA

213
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:23,157
You're cop? You still have accent

214
00:21:23,324 --> 00:21:24,366
Are you illegal immigrant?

215
00:21:24,533 --> 00:21:25,409
No

216
00:21:27,036 --> 00:21:28,287
These things can be bought everywhere

217
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:29,955
It's sold at 30 cents at Temple Street

218
00:21:33,083 --> 00:21:36,670
Look, I catch a thief for you

219
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,269
Come in here

220
00:21:57,775 --> 00:22:01,445
Get away. Sit down

221
00:22:08,828 --> 00:22:10,621
Who among you four is the chief?

222
00:22:10,830 --> 00:22:11,747
Chief

223
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:15,459
Buffalo, monkey, book them

224
00:22:16,085 --> 00:22:17,545
You with a beard, come over here

225
00:22:20,214 --> 00:22:20,965
Move away

226
00:22:23,175 --> 00:22:23,634
Sit

227
00:22:23,801 --> 00:22:24,802
Thank you

228
00:22:29,265 --> 00:22:30,015
Over there

229
00:22:30,766 --> 00:22:31,976
Okay, okay

230
00:22:38,232 --> 00:22:39,859
You didn't get me this time

231
00:22:40,109 --> 00:22:42,027
Country bumpkin, are you familiar
with the law of Hong Kong?

232
00:22:42,152 --> 00:22:43,445
No, I'm not familiar with the law of Hong Kong,

233
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,531
but I know everything about law in the States

234
00:22:46,198 --> 00:22:47,616
Kid from the mainland, how dare you
go so far as to commit robbery?

235
00:22:47,783 --> 00:22:48,659
When did you arrive?

236
00:22:48,993 --> 00:22:49,743
Just now

237
00:22:50,327 --> 00:22:52,121
Did you swim or climb over the hills?

238
00:22:52,663 --> 00:22:53,873
I came in on a flight

239
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:54,832
You got friends and relatives in Hong Kong?

240
00:22:54,999 --> 00:22:57,042
No relatives and no friends that I know

241
00:22:57,167 --> 00:22:58,377
But there's one person who knows me

242
00:22:58,544 --> 00:22:59,253
Who is that?

243
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,254
The Governor

244
00:23:03,674 --> 00:23:05,050
He called and invited me here

245
00:23:05,885 --> 00:23:07,678
Smart and slick, eh!

246
00:23:08,345 --> 00:23:09,847
Peasant, you have the right to remain silent,

247
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,057
but anything you say...

248
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:14,518
may used against me in court Is that right?

249
00:23:18,188 --> 00:23:18,981
Your name?

250
00:23:19,231 --> 00:23:21,650
Albert Au. Au Shui-keung

251
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,862
So it's become popular to have
an English name in the mainland

252
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:26,280
Where's your hometown?

253
00:23:26,447 --> 00:23:27,114
Tai-shan

254
00:23:27,448 --> 00:23:28,073
Are you married?

255
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:29,700
No. You?

256
00:23:29,867 --> 00:23:32,244
None of your business. Sex?

257
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:34,413
Ma'am, I have a beard

258
00:23:34,663 --> 00:23:35,331
So what?

259
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,208
That means I'm a man. Look at you!

260
00:23:38,375 --> 00:23:40,753
Your head don't look like a man's,
your body don't look like a woman's

261
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:43,088
Put them together you don't
look like a man or a woman

262
00:23:43,339 --> 00:23:44,590
What's your sex?

263
00:23:46,717 --> 00:23:47,551
What're you trying to do?

264
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,181
I didn't hit you and you hit me? Don't move!

265
00:23:52,723 --> 00:23:55,976
Excellent, excellent Absolutely marvellous!

266
00:23:58,145 --> 00:24:00,689
Super sleuth Kodojak, you're as good as they say

267
00:24:00,856 --> 00:24:03,567
Not really. This lady is even better

268
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:06,153
Of course Superintendent is very good

269
00:24:06,487 --> 00:24:10,324
She is also very efficient,
but a little slow with the gun

270
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:13,452
I've specially arranged for her

271
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:15,496
to assist you on this case

272
00:24:15,663 --> 00:24:17,581
She? No thanks

273
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,917
And to cover up your identity,

274
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:23,128
you two will pose as a married couple

275
00:24:23,253 --> 00:24:25,089
What? Him as my husband?

276
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:27,299
How can he be worthy of it with his looks?

277
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:28,801
Look at that face

278
00:24:28,968 --> 00:24:31,136
You bitch! I'll take you

279
00:24:31,387 --> 00:24:32,763
Fatty, have you booked me a room at the hotel?

280
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,347
Yes

281
00:24:33,514 --> 00:24:36,016
Get a room next to mine for her

282
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,309
I'm going to be her husband

283
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,352
Don't imagine it!

284
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:41,522
Are you scared of him, Superintendent Ho?

285
00:24:41,689 --> 00:24:42,564
Me, afraid of him?

286
00:24:42,773 --> 00:24:45,567
I'm just not used to hotels
Stay at my place, I dare you

287
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,610
Your place?

288
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,444
You chicken?

289
00:24:47,611 --> 00:24:51,281
Me chicken? I'm not afraid
even if her place is haunted

290
00:24:54,284 --> 00:24:57,705
Hey Baldy, don't treat me like a woman

291
00:24:57,913 --> 00:24:59,790
The whole precinct treats me like a man

292
00:25:00,374 --> 00:25:00,833
And remember

293
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:04,086
We're only pretending to be married
Don't you take it seriously

294
00:25:04,878 --> 00:25:07,798
Oh come on, I've seen it all before

295
00:25:07,965 --> 00:25:10,968
What's the big deal? Come on out, sissy

296
00:25:16,306 --> 00:25:18,183
According to my contact's information,

297
00:25:18,308 --> 00:25:20,644
those diamonds were stolen by him

298
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:24,648
He is called King Kong
His nickname is Flying Frog

299
00:25:24,898 --> 00:25:26,817
He has a partner called Bullshit Spring

300
00:25:26,984 --> 00:25:30,195
This is Bullshit Spring. He is women's sweetheart

301
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,740
He has many women's phone numbers

302
00:25:32,948 --> 00:25:35,826
They never show up after they did it

303
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:38,245
King Kong lives at 5th floor

304
00:26:01,602 --> 00:26:02,478
Hello

305
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:05,105
Hello, King Kong, I'm Bullshit Spring

306
00:26:05,272 --> 00:26:06,857
- Not my name again
- No...

307
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:08,734
Red Cat calling Black Cat, over

308
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,360
Black Cat roger. Please speak

309
00:26:10,903 --> 00:26:13,155
I'm going to hide those diamonds

310
00:26:13,447 --> 00:26:15,240
- Not diamonds again
- Peanuts

311
00:26:15,491 --> 00:26:17,951
I'm going to tell you where I hide the peanuts

312
00:26:18,744 --> 00:26:21,413
Don't tell me. I'll say it out in dream

313
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,248
I know that, but you know...

314
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,793
we'll screw up if I don't tell you

315
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:26,668
Why?

316
00:26:27,336 --> 00:26:29,379
Because I've fooled around with Madman's sister

317
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,507
How dare you!

318
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:32,716
You're going to die

319
00:26:32,883 --> 00:26:34,968
Why don't we talk at a resturant?

320
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,595
Okay, which one?

321
00:26:37,638 --> 00:26:38,555
I can't tell you now

322
00:26:39,181 --> 00:26:41,100
How can I know if you don't tell me?

323
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,439
Let me tell you secretly. Listen, Black Cat

324
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:49,399
It's Seven Heavens Resturant

325
00:26:50,025 --> 00:26:51,401
I can't hear it. Please speak louder

326
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:52,194
Idiot!

327
00:26:53,737 --> 00:26:55,531
Seven Heavens Resturant, sick cat

328
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,707
Go now, Black Cat is waiting at you

329
00:27:06,917 --> 00:27:08,210
You've fooled around with Madman's sister

330
00:27:08,377 --> 00:27:10,629
Just give back the diamonds to Black Cat

331
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:13,090
Not diamonds, peanuts

332
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:18,637
It's him

333
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,530
Ah! White Glove! It's him! Go after him

334
00:27:38,907 --> 00:27:39,616
King Kong!

335
00:27:39,825 --> 00:27:40,784
Oh no, it's her!

336
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:44,371
Stay right there, King Kong!

337
00:27:45,164 --> 00:27:47,040
Not that one, the other one!

338
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:11,607
You trying to kill me?

339
00:28:47,935 --> 00:28:49,561
Learn to drive for a few more years

340
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,520
You bastard!

341
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,855
Bye-bye, Baldy

342
00:28:52,022 --> 00:28:57,027
Don't you go, don't you go... I'll catch you

343
00:29:04,785 --> 00:29:07,037
Hold it right there, Flying Spider!

344
00:29:22,386 --> 00:29:23,762
Stop, police

345
00:29:29,101 --> 00:29:34,898
Bye-bye. Chai-pau, bye

346
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,859
Stop!

347
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:57,629
A table for how many sir?

348
00:29:58,505 --> 00:29:59,256
I'll help myself

349
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:08,181
Panda here. The diamonds

350
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:09,308
No, I mean, the peanuts...

351
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:12,019
are very well hidden

352
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,186
And I've tattooed the secret respectively

353
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:15,772
on the bodies of two women

354
00:30:17,399 --> 00:30:19,276
Keep talking, no need to be so nervous

355
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,486
No need to be so nervous?
You know how in the movies

356
00:30:21,611 --> 00:30:22,863
the one who's telling the secret always gets killed

357
00:30:23,030 --> 00:30:24,906
before he's half way through talking

358
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:27,951
Don't worry, the one who listens doesn't get killed

359
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:30,370
Get it out

360
00:30:31,330 --> 00:30:33,790
The diamonds...

361
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:35,709
What is it?

362
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,377
I'm shot. Can't you see?

363
00:30:40,589 --> 00:30:43,592
It's only the champagne Get on with it

364
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,972
It's not safe here. Let's go to the washroom

365
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:55,312
Okay. Now I can talk

366
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:56,271
Go on

367
00:30:56,938 --> 00:31:00,942
I put the diamonds...
I mean, the peanuts in Kowloon...

368
00:31:01,109 --> 00:31:02,194
Wait, hush

369
00:31:02,361 --> 00:31:02,986
Why?

370
00:31:03,779 --> 00:31:05,822
Don't worry, go ahead

371
00:31:05,989 --> 00:31:08,033
I'm deaf, I can't hear anything

372
00:31:09,034 --> 00:31:11,328
He's dumb. He didn't say anything.
Come on, let's go

373
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:17,584
Eh, what is it?

374
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:18,919
Mad Max!

375
00:31:21,463 --> 00:31:22,464
Oh no this is the end

376
00:31:22,631 --> 00:31:23,507
Let's slip out from the back

377
00:31:33,308 --> 00:31:34,017
Come in here,

378
00:31:38,563 --> 00:31:40,399
Go on, there's no one here

379
00:31:40,565 --> 00:31:42,067
The peanuts are...

380
00:31:43,235 --> 00:31:45,028
Wait, don't you find this lift kind of small?

381
00:31:48,990 --> 00:31:50,450
Watch it to your right

382
00:31:50,909 --> 00:31:51,993
Keep an eye on your left

383
00:31:53,954 --> 00:31:55,122
Mind your back

384
00:32:01,628 --> 00:32:05,757
It's okay, they are ghosts

385
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:07,676
You're a ghost!

386
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,597
Take it easy. We'll talk against
the Ching and restore the Ming,

387
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:13,890
the Shaolin monk shaves his head,

388
00:32:14,057 --> 00:32:15,517
the burning of the Red Lotus Temple

389
00:32:15,684 --> 00:32:16,560
What's that?

390
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:18,645
To repeat every word a second time

391
00:32:18,812 --> 00:32:19,729
Get on with it then

392
00:32:21,106 --> 00:32:22,399
The the peapee nutnuts a-are

393
00:32:22,566 --> 00:32:24,234
inin cowkow loonloon

394
00:32:24,401 --> 00:32:25,193
What did you say?

395
00:32:25,777 --> 00:32:27,988
The peanuts are in Kowloon

396
00:32:30,907 --> 00:32:32,534
Ex-x cuse-cuse me-me

397
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:41,251
Even a girl can do it See how stupid you are

398
00:32:42,419 --> 00:32:44,087
There's nobody in the lift now

399
00:32:46,047 --> 00:32:47,048
Hang on

400
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,426
Over there

401
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:28,840
Black Cat, I'm up here, I'm scared like hell

402
00:33:29,049 --> 00:33:32,302
Remember that, Rose

403
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:33,970
What's rose?

404
00:33:34,804 --> 00:33:37,516
Panda, what's going on with you?

405
00:33:37,682 --> 00:33:40,477
What's going on with me? Can't you see?

406
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:44,606
I'm hanging on in mid-air

407
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:45,941
Are you okay?

408
00:33:46,107 --> 00:33:47,150
I'm okay. I'm sorry

409
00:33:47,317 --> 00:33:50,612
You won't get the peanuts

410
00:33:50,779 --> 00:33:53,114
That's alright, Panda, You just remember,

411
00:33:53,281 --> 00:33:57,327
no matter what, we're always an ace partnership

412
00:33:59,162 --> 00:33:59,913
Panda!

413
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,194
I've caught White Glove

414
00:34:31,486 --> 00:34:33,738
He's not White Glvoe

415
00:34:33,863 --> 00:34:35,699
White Glove is a foreign woman

416
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,450
I'm sure he is the thief...

417
00:34:37,617 --> 00:34:38,994
who stole the diamonds

418
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,161
He doesn't look like a good thief

419
00:34:40,328 --> 00:34:40,704
No

420
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,456
I've an idea. Let me test him

421
00:34:43,832 --> 00:34:45,000
How?

422
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,210
I learned some scienticfic examination

423
00:34:47,377 --> 00:34:48,878
at Scotland Yard

424
00:34:49,504 --> 00:34:51,047
But you have to work with me

425
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:56,761
Please take a seat, sir

426
00:34:59,139 --> 00:35:00,557
Leave that. Take a seat

427
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,809
I'll not answer any questions

428
00:35:02,976 --> 00:35:04,227
before my lawyer arrives

429
00:35:04,394 --> 00:35:06,563
Let's try an IQ test

430
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,064
Better wait until my lawyer arrives

431
00:35:08,231 --> 00:35:09,858
Do you know who I am?

432
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,067
No I don't

433
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:14,779
I'm Kodojak, the famous No. 1 Chinese inspector

434
00:35:14,946 --> 00:35:17,782
from the US to study at Scotland Yard

435
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:19,909
Surely you have heard of my name before

436
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:20,869
Oh yes, yes

437
00:35:21,036 --> 00:35:22,120
Let's co-operate

438
00:35:22,287 --> 00:35:23,747
Better wait until my lawyer arrives

439
00:35:23,913 --> 00:35:24,247
Bastard

440
00:35:24,414 --> 00:35:25,165
Give me your hand

441
00:35:25,582 --> 00:35:28,668
It's not that I don't respect you,
but you know... Ow ow ow

442
00:35:28,835 --> 00:35:30,170
What're owing about I haven't even started yet

443
00:35:30,337 --> 00:35:32,005
Now easy does it

444
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:32,839
Give it to me

445
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:36,801
Give it to me

446
00:35:38,345 --> 00:35:39,429
Sir, I think we'll try the IQ test

447
00:35:39,596 --> 00:35:40,597
Good

448
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:43,391
This is a test of reflexes

449
00:35:43,683 --> 00:35:45,810
Produce a hand We'll take turns to hit each other

450
00:35:45,977 --> 00:35:48,146
Whoever hits his opponent is the winner

451
00:35:48,855 --> 00:35:49,606
Who goes first?

452
00:35:49,773 --> 00:35:51,733
Me, of course
Put out a hand

453
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,200
- Ah look over
- there

454
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:05,955
My turn

455
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:07,082
Can we stop now?

456
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,375
Put your hand out

457
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,296
Make up your mind, which one?

458
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:14,547
This one

459
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:15,965
You sure it's this one?

460
00:36:16,966 --> 00:36:17,717
Yes

461
00:36:18,468 --> 00:36:19,219
There's my Lawyer

462
00:36:27,310 --> 00:36:28,770
My turn now

463
00:36:32,941 --> 00:36:37,112
Bastard. Where's my gun?

464
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:38,196
Here

465
00:36:42,325 --> 00:36:43,159
This isn't mine

466
00:36:43,326 --> 00:36:44,661
Yours with her

467
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,791
Are you through with your games?

468
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:51,042
I know another game

469
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,962
I've been playing it all my life I'll win

470
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,171
What if you lost again?

471
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:56,506
Then you go free

472
00:36:58,216 --> 00:36:59,050
Come on, come on

473
00:37:00,760 --> 00:37:02,637
It's very simple
Hold your ear with the right hand,

474
00:37:02,804 --> 00:37:05,598
put your left hand on the floor and turn five times

475
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:07,308
Then go forward to pick the card up

476
00:37:07,475 --> 00:37:09,269
If you can do it you win

477
00:37:09,436 --> 00:37:11,479
If not you'll have to work with me

478
00:37:11,688 --> 00:37:13,481
No problem. First you show me how

479
00:37:13,648 --> 00:37:16,359
Easy, like a kid sings a song

480
00:37:16,526 --> 00:37:17,736
Hold the ear, touch the ground,

481
00:37:17,986 --> 00:37:19,279
head down, bottoms up

482
00:37:19,446 --> 00:37:23,908
Make 1 turn, slow and lazy
Make 2 turns, simply daisy

483
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:27,537
Make 3 turns, slightly pacy
Make 4 turns, getting dizzy

484
00:37:27,704 --> 00:37:29,706
Make 5 turns, going crazy, See?

485
00:37:29,914 --> 00:37:31,040
I get it, let's go

486
00:37:31,332 --> 00:37:32,500
Okay, let's go

487
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,795
Which side do we start?

488
00:37:35,962 --> 00:37:37,255
Stupid,

489
00:37:37,422 --> 00:37:39,215
follow me

490
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:40,717
So slow?

491
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,803
I can go faster. I'm making it easy
for you. See? Right?

492
00:37:44,429 --> 00:37:46,181
You'll never make it at this speed?

493
00:37:46,347 --> 00:37:48,391
Sure I can, See it's already my third,

494
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:51,227
fourth and fifth. Right?

495
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:53,438
I get it. Let's start

496
00:37:53,605 --> 00:37:54,564
Come on

497
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:59,027
Make 1 turn, slow and lazy
Make 2 turns, simply daisy

498
00:37:59,194 --> 00:38:03,698
Make 3 turns, slightly pacy
Make 4 turns, getting hazy

499
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,535
Make 5 turns, going crazy
Make 6 turns...

500
00:38:08,745 --> 00:38:09,579
Hard work.

501
00:38:14,083 --> 00:38:14,793
Bye-bye

502
00:38:15,835 --> 00:38:17,337
I'm out of form

503
00:38:17,504 --> 00:38:19,881
I used to make it all the time

504
00:38:20,048 --> 00:38:22,592
He's gone, What're you up to?

505
00:38:23,635 --> 00:38:25,011
Just taking a breather

506
00:38:59,128 --> 00:38:59,712
Hello

507
00:39:00,213 --> 00:39:02,799
I'm White Glove, I want to kill you

508
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,012
You'll have to wait

509
00:39:08,388 --> 00:39:09,180
Why?

510
00:39:09,597 --> 00:39:10,807
Because there's someone at the door, jerk

511
00:39:26,531 --> 00:39:28,700
Spare me, chief

512
00:39:35,248 --> 00:39:37,876
Stay right here, kid, I'll get my gang after you

513
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:39,127
Your gang?

514
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:47,552
That's him. Get him

515
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:21,961
Ma'am, he's locked himself in

516
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:24,756
Good. Proceed to step no. 2

517
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:25,840
Yes ma'am

518
00:40:37,143 --> 00:40:40,772
Police? Someone is trying to break in

519
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:44,525
You got the wrong number, I am White Glove

520
00:40:44,776 --> 00:40:48,279
I have a present for you,
go take a look at the door

521
00:40:54,577 --> 00:40:55,411
What is it?

522
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:39,288
Exactly the same tactics

523
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,833
as in the diamond job

524
00:42:20,038 --> 00:42:22,123
Your turn, Benny Chan

525
00:43:15,384 --> 00:43:17,553
Don't be scared, I'm right here

526
00:43:18,721 --> 00:43:19,806
I can't get it out

527
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:21,349
Turn it the other way round

528
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:26,521
Oh no, look behind you

529
00:43:33,069 --> 00:43:35,279
If it weren't for me you'd be dead

530
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:36,739
Thank you for saving my life

531
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:38,074
How do you propose to pay me back?

532
00:43:38,407 --> 00:43:39,826
Wait till my lawyer arrives

533
00:43:42,411 --> 00:43:47,041
Get me up first

534
00:43:47,208 --> 00:43:49,335
I'm now working on the diamond case

535
00:43:49,502 --> 00:43:50,461
I didn't do it

536
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,046
Then I must have got the wrong person

537
00:43:52,296 --> 00:43:55,591
I confess, I confess,

538
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:56,926
I did it, I did it...

539
00:43:57,301 --> 00:43:58,928
Now where're the diamonds?

540
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:00,096
I don't know where they are

541
00:44:00,388 --> 00:44:02,723
Don't scare me, my hands might fail

542
00:44:02,890 --> 00:44:04,892
Don't let them! I'll tell you

543
00:44:05,101 --> 00:44:06,894
So where're the diamonds

544
00:44:07,061 --> 00:44:08,020
Panda has them hidden somewhere

545
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:09,063
And where is Panda now?

546
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,314
He's dead

547
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:11,691
You're scaring me again

548
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:12,775
Okay, okay

549
00:44:12,942 --> 00:44:14,735
I promise I'll help you recover the diamonds

550
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:17,113
And after that

551
00:44:17,321 --> 00:44:19,198
you'll help me get White Glove

552
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:21,325
Alright, but you'll have to promise me one thing

553
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:22,493
What is it?

554
00:44:22,743 --> 00:44:23,828
That you won't press charges against me

555
00:44:24,036 --> 00:44:25,788
You have my word

556
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:27,206
How can I be sure of it?

557
00:44:27,456 --> 00:44:28,332
I swear

558
00:44:36,757 --> 00:44:37,884
Is the bomb ready?

559
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:38,801
Yes, it's ready

560
00:44:39,135 --> 00:44:40,011
Bring it up

561
00:44:40,761 --> 00:44:41,220
The bugging device?

562
00:44:41,387 --> 00:44:42,680
It's being installed

563
00:44:42,847 --> 00:44:44,056
Who did you send?

564
00:44:44,348 --> 00:44:45,141
Blabbermouth

565
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,934
You can hear him breathe!

566
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:50,396
Don't worry. Not this time

567
00:44:53,482 --> 00:44:54,358
I can't stay in this place

568
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,277
for more than a minute

569
00:44:56,527 --> 00:44:58,529
It's so dead, How can I live here?

570
00:44:58,821 --> 00:45:00,156
Why don't you eat your supper?

571
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:02,700
Eat! Look at these steaks

572
00:45:02,867 --> 00:45:04,994
They're absolutely tasteless, awful, disgusting

573
00:45:05,161 --> 00:45:06,162
You punk

574
00:45:06,329 --> 00:45:07,788
And then there's you, Baldy

575
00:45:07,955 --> 00:45:10,917
Rude, repulsive
And I have to share a room with him?

576
00:45:13,753 --> 00:45:15,588
And also, the foul air in here

577
00:45:15,755 --> 00:45:18,132
is absolutely, suffocating

578
00:45:25,097 --> 00:45:27,558
See, not a sound to the end

579
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:29,185
What about the bomb?

580
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:30,436
It's already up there

581
00:45:32,271 --> 00:45:33,773
Even the door bell sounds bad

582
00:45:35,524 --> 00:45:36,192
What is it?

583
00:45:36,609 --> 00:45:37,443
Delivering shoes

584
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,445
Must be my sister's Just leave it

585
00:45:39,612 --> 00:45:40,279
Leave it!

586
00:45:40,446 --> 00:45:41,072
Yes

587
00:45:44,825 --> 00:45:47,078
I can't stand it any longer,

588
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,413
I'm going home

589
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:50,623
I'll be at my place if you want me

590
00:45:58,297 --> 00:45:58,965
Hello

591
00:45:59,215 --> 00:46:00,007
Hello

592
00:46:00,633 --> 00:46:01,717
I live here

593
00:46:02,343 --> 00:46:03,552
Me too

594
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,724
So you're home, sis, Don't look at him

595
00:46:08,891 --> 00:46:10,851
He's got red eye disease, Come on in

596
00:46:20,528 --> 00:46:23,072
Sis, who're these two people?

597
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:24,740
Let me introduce them to you

598
00:46:24,907 --> 00:46:26,909
This guy here you don't need to know

599
00:46:27,118 --> 00:46:29,495
And this one here isn't worth the bother, Sit down

600
00:46:32,999 --> 00:46:33,582
Sit down

601
00:46:34,125 --> 00:46:36,711
Hey! Didn't you say you're leaving?

602
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:37,920
Yeah, beat it, scram

603
00:46:38,087 --> 00:46:40,381
It doesn't matter
Why don't you stay a little longer?

604
00:46:46,554 --> 00:46:48,723
Sister, Japan was a lot of fun

605
00:46:49,682 --> 00:46:50,808
Have you been there before?

606
00:46:51,267 --> 00:46:51,934
Yes

607
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:53,144
On business?

608
00:46:53,602 --> 00:46:55,104
No, on a job

609
00:46:55,896 --> 00:46:56,397
Hey!

610
00:46:56,564 --> 00:46:58,816
Have you seen that?

611
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:02,403
He's obsessed with your sister

612
00:47:03,112 --> 00:47:05,239
He can't even know his dad's name now

613
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:06,699
What's your father's last name?

614
00:47:07,033 --> 00:47:08,117
I haven't the slightest idea

615
00:47:08,284 --> 00:47:09,577
Did you steal the diamonds?

616
00:47:09,744 --> 00:47:11,078
Yes I did

617
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:12,621
Where did you hide them

618
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:14,332
Panda hid them

619
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:15,958
How can we recover them?

620
00:47:16,125 --> 00:47:19,670
He wrote the secret on the bodies of two women

621
00:47:19,879 --> 00:47:21,589
How do I find them?

622
00:47:21,797 --> 00:47:22,673
Now that I've found you

623
00:47:23,007 --> 00:47:26,052
why do I have to look for them, dearie

624
00:47:27,970 --> 00:47:30,348
Now you heard it, Baldy

625
00:47:30,639 --> 00:47:33,225
I told you this punk stole the diamonds

626
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,810
Are you pulling my leg?

627
00:47:35,144 --> 00:47:36,270
How would I?

628
00:47:36,562 --> 00:47:39,065
I'd lie to that filthy Baldy and that dirty bitch

629
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,191
but I'll never lie to you

630
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:41,776
Why're you holding my hand?

631
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:43,944
So what, we're both men

632
00:47:45,446 --> 00:47:46,322
Now you hear

633
00:47:46,572 --> 00:47:48,699
Only that kid knows where the diamonds are

634
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,284
I now command you

635
00:47:50,451 --> 00:47:52,870
to be responsible for his safety

636
00:47:53,037 --> 00:47:55,373
before he finds the diamonds

637
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:56,832
Oh no, Ah Cheong's taken the bomb up there

638
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,667
What? Where's Ah Cheong?

639
00:47:58,834 --> 00:47:59,460
Here!

640
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,545
Go up there and bring it back Be quick

641
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,798
There isn't enough time

642
00:48:03,964 --> 00:48:04,673
Why?

643
00:48:05,091 --> 00:48:06,467
There's only time for the trip up,
not for the trip down

644
00:48:06,634 --> 00:48:10,596
I don't care. One way or the other
I won't let you blow him to pieces

645
00:48:11,847 --> 00:48:13,307
Aren't you gonna leave?

646
00:48:14,934 --> 00:48:16,852
Me, leave? Wow look!

647
00:48:19,939 --> 00:48:22,858
The air has become fresher,
Baldy's head has become balder,

648
00:48:23,067 --> 00:48:26,654
the steaks have become tastier,
but your sis is a little fierce...

649
00:48:27,113 --> 00:48:27,947
What're you say?

650
00:48:28,239 --> 00:48:29,573
Just a teeny weeny little bit

651
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:31,659
Even the door bell sounds better,

652
00:48:31,826 --> 00:48:33,577
and I enjoy opening the door better

653
00:48:34,203 --> 00:48:34,954
Wrong address

654
00:48:35,204 --> 00:48:36,455
That's a bit stupid,

655
00:48:36,872 --> 00:48:39,875
these shoes are a bit heavy,
and please leave a bit more quickly

656
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:47,883
It's yours

657
00:48:57,601 --> 00:49:00,771
The Gigolo Joe tattoo...

658
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:04,400
is from this man, I hope he remenber.

659
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:08,487
Be a buddy and think carefully,

660
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:10,823
what did Gigolo Joe tattooed on his body lately?

661
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:13,868
They're always women's names or telephone numbers

662
00:49:14,285 --> 00:49:17,079
He has a whole body of them How can I remember?

663
00:49:17,413 --> 00:49:19,457
Then did he bring any girl for a tattoo?

664
00:49:20,207 --> 00:49:22,293
Yes, and two of them

665
00:49:22,585 --> 00:49:25,921
But he's really outrageous;
he wanted them done here

666
00:49:27,798 --> 00:49:29,633
You surely remember what you've tattooed

667
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,677
How? I'd need to install a computer here

668
00:49:31,844 --> 00:49:34,054
to remember everyone who comes in here

669
00:49:39,059 --> 00:49:40,811
Hoho! Another clue gone

670
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:42,521
A dog's chance we have to find the diamonds

671
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,064
and fat chance you got to go to gaol

672
00:49:44,231 --> 00:49:45,149
I won't worry so much

673
00:49:45,316 --> 00:49:47,526
We still have another clue but it's gonna be tough

674
00:49:47,693 --> 00:49:48,360
What is it?

675
00:49:48,611 --> 00:49:49,445
Gigolo Joe shouted Rose

676
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:50,905
before he died

677
00:49:51,197 --> 00:49:52,490
I suspect that's the name

678
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:53,574
of a girl friend

679
00:49:53,741 --> 00:49:54,408
Hello there

680
00:49:55,576 --> 00:49:57,786
Did you just come out from the tattoo place?

681
00:49:57,953 --> 00:49:58,662
Yes

682
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:02,124
Then you must have a picture taken at my place

683
00:50:02,291 --> 00:50:03,000
Why?

684
00:50:03,250 --> 00:50:04,418
Because everyone who's just got a tattoo

685
00:50:04,585 --> 00:50:05,836
comes to my studio

686
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:07,129
for a picture

687
00:50:08,297 --> 00:50:09,465
Do you think Gigolo Joe...?

688
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:10,841
No more "do you think"

689
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,468
This is it right here

690
00:50:14,470 --> 00:50:15,721
Rose?

691
00:50:18,140 --> 00:50:20,392
Well, actually we didn't come here for a photo

692
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:23,646
Then what're you doing here?

693
00:50:23,854 --> 00:50:26,774
Get the hell out of here

694
00:50:27,775 --> 00:50:29,401
We come to pick up some photos for a friend

695
00:50:29,985 --> 00:50:30,778
Who is it?

696
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:33,155
Did anybody have a nude picture
taken here recently?

697
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,366
Why, Lo-men did

698
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:38,494
So you're friends of Lo-men

699
00:50:38,827 --> 00:50:40,829
No, we're friends of Gigolo Joe

700
00:50:41,497 --> 00:50:43,249
I don't know what you're yelping about? Peasant!

701
00:50:43,499 --> 00:50:45,834
You know, the guy who has

702
00:50:46,126 --> 00:50:47,086
his body tattooed with telephone numbers

703
00:50:47,253 --> 00:50:48,254
and mumbles

704
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,006
Yes I know, you mean Panda

705
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:51,882
That's him

706
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:55,636
That's pauper! He left two dollars and disappeared

707
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:57,888
The photos are vital to us

708
00:50:58,055 --> 00:51:00,182
Nothing doing I don't know where I've put them

709
00:51:00,349 --> 00:51:02,101
I'm very busy Go away!

710
00:51:02,268 --> 00:51:02,851
Please take the trouble to...

711
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:05,896
Let me handle this Keep watch for me

712
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,481
and call when someone turns up

713
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:13,362
You're in for it now

714
00:51:23,414 --> 00:51:25,082
What do you want? Money?

715
00:51:25,249 --> 00:51:26,125
No

716
00:51:28,210 --> 00:51:29,253
I've a husband

717
00:51:29,962 --> 00:51:31,297
Not a problem

718
00:51:31,672 --> 00:51:32,756
I'm quite old

719
00:51:33,173 --> 00:51:34,675
Just the right age

720
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:35,926
I'm not even pretty

721
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:37,511
Better than nothing

722
00:51:43,225 --> 00:51:46,228
What? A stocking!

723
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:50,316
This way she won't recognize me

724
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,528
You better put one on too,
or else she'd recognize you

725
00:51:54,778 --> 00:51:55,571
No

726
00:52:06,415 --> 00:52:09,001
Take it easy please I'll give you the photos

727
00:52:13,922 --> 00:52:14,840
Well done

728
00:52:28,854 --> 00:52:31,774
Haha! Both of them are here

729
00:52:34,193 --> 00:52:35,069
Here I got it

730
00:52:35,235 --> 00:52:36,737
One of the girls works at this taxi service centre

731
00:52:36,904 --> 00:52:38,238
Let me do the talking

732
00:52:38,405 --> 00:52:38,822
Why?

733
00:52:38,947 --> 00:52:40,699
You could handle that cause she was an old dame

734
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:43,285
This one here is a young girl,
only I can handle this

735
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:44,620
I'm not so sure

736
00:52:44,828 --> 00:52:46,413
I was once in a

737
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:47,998
The Most Charming Man Contest in Chinatown

738
00:52:48,165 --> 00:52:48,749
And?

739
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,292
I won, of course

740
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:51,126
How many entrants were there?

741
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:52,294
Just me

742
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:55,047
Anyway, let me do the talking

743
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:57,800
Hey! Let's get this clear I'm here doing a case,

744
00:52:57,966 --> 00:52:59,134
so naturally I do the talking

745
00:52:59,301 --> 00:52:59,843
Ouch!

746
00:53:00,344 --> 00:53:00,844
Wow!

747
00:53:05,015 --> 00:53:06,058
What's your problem? Got hit by a ghost?

748
00:53:06,392 --> 00:53:07,768
Let's go and don't waste any more time

749
00:53:09,728 --> 00:53:11,021
Did you run into someone just now?

750
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:14,149
He hit my waist and knock on my head

751
00:53:15,484 --> 00:53:17,236
Now let me do the talking You just keep quiet

752
00:53:17,403 --> 00:53:18,612
No, I want to talk

753
00:53:18,779 --> 00:53:19,530
I said I'll do the talking

754
00:53:19,697 --> 00:53:20,322
No, I want to talk

755
00:53:20,489 --> 00:53:21,073
Hush

756
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:21,990
What?

757
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:25,035
A car ran into a traffic light outside

758
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,578
the Kowloon Transport Department
and the traffic is now jammed up

759
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,417
Yes. Taxi service centre, Got it

760
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:35,045
993, your wife wants to know
if you'll be home for dinner

761
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,214
Tell her no

762
00:53:37,381 --> 00:53:38,507
How about having dinner with me, Mary?

763
00:53:38,674 --> 00:53:40,426
Sure, but I'm busy tonight

764
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,803
Miss Mary? Hi

765
00:53:42,970 --> 00:53:43,721
Who are you?

766
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,055
I'm Joe's lawyer,

767
00:53:45,305 --> 00:53:46,598
and this is his father

768
00:53:46,974 --> 00:53:47,725
Hello, daughter

769
00:53:49,309 --> 00:53:51,186
That guy's so ubiquitous

770
00:53:51,562 --> 00:53:53,021
How do I know where the hell he's now?

771
00:53:53,981 --> 00:53:55,607
Even you are cursing him

772
00:53:56,859 --> 00:53:57,901
He really is dead

773
00:53:58,110 --> 00:53:59,361
but we don't know where he died

774
00:53:59,528 --> 00:54:00,154
Really?

775
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,740
Yes, and it was a violent death

776
00:54:02,948 --> 00:54:03,907
And he was calling your name

777
00:54:04,074 --> 00:54:06,535
before he died Poor guy

778
00:54:09,121 --> 00:54:11,415
He was calling my name?

779
00:54:12,708 --> 00:54:14,585
Yes

780
00:54:18,213 --> 00:54:21,216
A lady has lost her beloved Pekingese puppy,

781
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,720
whoever finds it please call in

782
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:28,223
Councilor Chan, this girl has such a good heart

783
00:54:28,932 --> 00:54:33,437
May God bless... the Pekingese

784
00:54:33,937 --> 00:54:35,522
He's left you an inheritance

785
00:54:36,732 --> 00:54:38,108
An inheritance? How much?

786
00:54:39,026 --> 00:54:40,235
Almost five hundred thousand dollars

787
00:54:40,527 --> 00:54:41,445
American dollars!

788
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:46,742
Oh really?

789
00:54:48,452 --> 00:54:49,578
They found the Pekingese

790
00:54:49,745 --> 00:54:51,705
Thank you Lord. Thank you Joe

791
00:54:53,165 --> 00:54:56,251
Father, what does this Joe
have to do with the Lord?

792
00:55:01,715 --> 00:55:02,633
Make yourselves comfortable

793
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:03,967
Thank you

794
00:55:04,343 --> 00:55:06,178
Before we can get on with the procedures,

795
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,305
we must have proof of your identity

796
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:09,681
Sure. I have my identity card here

797
00:55:09,848 --> 00:55:11,433
No! He wants to look at...

798
00:55:12,476 --> 00:55:13,852
the distinguishing marks on your body

799
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:16,980
That bastard! He even told you these things?

800
00:55:17,231 --> 00:55:18,315
I was drunk that night

801
00:55:18,482 --> 00:55:20,943
Ah ha, so you like drinking

802
00:55:21,109 --> 00:55:24,613
Yes. Okay

803
00:55:25,572 --> 00:55:27,825
A car has caught fire outside
the Mongkok Fire Department

804
00:55:27,991 --> 00:55:28,492
And a hearse has run over someone

805
00:55:28,659 --> 00:55:30,702
outside the Hong Kong Funeral Home

806
00:55:30,869 --> 00:55:31,829
What a lot of fuss!

807
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,206
You two are really preposterous

808
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:36,625
You want to look at my ass!

809
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,878
Wow! Just one look and it's $500,000

810
00:55:41,547 --> 00:55:44,383
For $500,000 you can look at mine

811
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:45,801
Wouldn't you guys as well?

812
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,145
What if I won't let you?

813
00:55:57,312 --> 00:56:00,148
Then the inheritance will automically

814
00:56:00,315 --> 00:56:01,316
go to his father

815
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:05,112
You got any proof that he's Joe's father?

816
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:09,491
I love papa

817
00:56:11,118 --> 00:56:12,411
Where're we going anyway?

818
00:56:14,705 --> 00:56:17,291
Here. You can take the photo yourself,

819
00:56:18,750 --> 00:56:19,835
and there won't be any embarrassment

820
00:56:20,752 --> 00:56:22,045
No, it's too embarrassing

821
00:56:22,588 --> 00:56:23,714
But for $500,000...

822
00:56:24,172 --> 00:56:25,382
I don't have any change on me

823
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,593
I do. Please

824
00:56:32,014 --> 00:56:34,057
Don't peep

825
00:56:34,224 --> 00:56:35,934
Alright. Remember,

826
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,478
not the front, but the mark

827
00:56:46,737 --> 00:56:49,072
It's his daughter getting a photo for her school

828
00:56:49,239 --> 00:56:51,199
She's entering the Miss Hong Kong Beauty Pageant

829
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:05,255
Oh my brother

830
00:57:10,552 --> 00:57:12,304
Sir, here're your pictures

831
00:57:12,804 --> 00:57:15,223
and suitcase. Bye

832
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:16,725
Stay right here

833
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:21,271
Who are you please?

834
00:57:32,032 --> 00:57:35,118
Howdy Max

835
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:42,501
Who is he?

836
00:57:42,834 --> 00:57:45,712
He's Mad Max who killed Joe

837
00:57:45,879 --> 00:57:48,048
I don't know this guy, You two go on

838
00:57:52,719 --> 00:57:54,179
And who're you?

839
00:57:58,100 --> 00:57:59,017
That was an accident

840
00:58:01,937 --> 00:58:03,355
I wasn't even ready!

841
00:58:05,524 --> 00:58:07,150
Hey kid, it looks tough

842
00:58:08,694 --> 00:58:10,946
It's alright. We're brothers

843
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,823
Even when you're dead there's still me

844
00:58:13,865 --> 00:58:17,786
Who doesn't know this is my territory?

845
00:58:18,578 --> 00:58:22,290
You got guts to lure my sister for nude pictures

846
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,167
Whose idea was it?

847
00:58:25,168 --> 00:58:26,837
We don't stand a chance
if you or I take it on himself;

848
00:58:27,129 --> 00:58:28,547
we might get away with a heavy beating
if we both admit it

849
00:58:28,714 --> 00:58:30,048
What do you say?

850
00:58:30,215 --> 00:58:31,633
Deal

851
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:34,886
Come on, Whose idea was it?

852
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:36,847
It was our idea

853
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,807
Who thought of this trick?

854
00:58:39,057 --> 00:58:40,976
We both did

855
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,562
Who told my sister to do it?

856
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,188
We both did

857
00:58:45,814 --> 00:58:46,523
You got guts

858
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,316
We both do

859
00:58:48,984 --> 00:58:50,110
Very smart!

860
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,404
We both are

861
00:59:03,040 --> 00:59:04,374
What do we do now?

862
00:59:04,958 --> 00:59:06,376
It'll be alright Confess to some of it

863
00:59:07,794 --> 00:59:09,337
So whose idea was it?

864
00:59:09,713 --> 00:59:12,132
Ah! Mine, at this moment

865
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,012
Aw! It really hurts!

866
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,056
Did you have a part in it?

867
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:20,348
Confess to some of it, quick!

868
00:59:20,766 --> 00:59:22,434
He said to confess some of it

869
00:59:24,686 --> 00:59:25,645
Help! This is painful

870
00:59:25,812 --> 00:59:27,022
Don't be afraid, just hang on

871
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,274
I'll come down when I catch my breath

872
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,530
My turn now

873
00:59:35,697 --> 00:59:37,240
My nose's smaller than yours

874
00:59:37,365 --> 00:59:38,366
I have to take a few more breaths

875
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,701
Hurry, hurry

876
00:59:40,243 --> 00:59:41,411
Here I come

877
00:59:44,539 --> 00:59:48,251
It feels so good
I really don't want to get back up there

878
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:51,046
Hey, it's my turn now It really hurts

879
00:59:51,379 --> 00:59:52,798
Say pretty please

880
00:59:53,048 --> 00:59:54,382
Pretty please

881
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,259
Here I come

882
00:59:56,802 --> 01:00:00,388
I'm tricked, Let me down

883
01:00:00,555 --> 01:00:01,348
What's your hurry?

884
01:00:01,515 --> 01:00:03,225
Catch a few breaths up there

885
01:00:03,642 --> 01:00:04,351
You asshole!

886
01:00:04,518 --> 01:00:07,020
Let me down, this is killing me

887
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,818
Let me down! I'm dying. I'm dead

888
01:00:18,240 --> 01:00:19,533
Haha, you're not dead

889
01:00:20,784 --> 01:00:21,910
Never will I die before you

890
01:00:22,244 --> 01:00:24,454
If I hadn't said that,
you wouldn't have let me down

891
01:00:25,664 --> 01:00:26,832
Okay, it's my turn now

892
01:00:26,998 --> 01:00:29,417
No wait, I want a full share of air

893
01:00:30,502 --> 01:00:31,419
You cheat!

894
01:00:31,586 --> 01:00:34,256
You're nuts. Who's cheating?
I'm catching my breath

895
01:00:34,422 --> 01:00:36,383
You dirty Baldy! You told me to confess,

896
01:00:36,550 --> 01:00:38,218
it was all your idea

897
01:00:39,970 --> 01:00:41,346
So it was your idea

898
01:00:47,936 --> 01:00:49,437
Right, that's right Jab one for me

899
01:00:49,604 --> 01:00:51,773
You punk. You sell me out!
You try to kill me with his knife!

900
01:00:51,940 --> 01:00:54,818
Fatso! It was really his idea!

901
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:58,613
What? Did you hear him?

902
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,407
He called you Fatso, Right? Big brother Max

903
01:01:00,574 --> 01:01:02,492
I said Fatso to his face

904
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,953
It's better than you calling him
Max the Pimp behind his back

905
01:01:05,120 --> 01:01:05,787
What?

906
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,507
You punk. You wanna catch a breath
Now you're really in for it

907
01:01:18,258 --> 01:01:20,218
Don't you worry

908
01:01:20,802 --> 01:01:22,929
I know it well here Trains don't run through here

909
01:01:23,346 --> 01:01:24,055
They don't?

910
01:01:28,977 --> 01:01:30,979
No train? Hal!

911
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:33,857
This can run you to pieces Get a move on

912
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,061
It's really nothing, We needn't be hospitalized

913
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,438
And you have to ask for this room on this floor

914
01:02:14,147 --> 01:02:16,191
Just shut up. And stop obstructing
the world's movement

915
01:02:17,234 --> 01:02:19,194
Just ring if you need anything

916
01:02:19,361 --> 01:02:21,863
Sur-r-r-r-e!

917
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,246
Hi

918
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:13,915
Are you two ignoring my existence?

919
01:03:15,959 --> 01:03:17,585
I think I'll go and get on with my work

920
01:03:22,090 --> 01:03:25,093
Wow! Haha!

921
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,594
I think I've caught her fancy

922
01:03:26,761 --> 01:03:27,971
But you still got nothing going with Chai-pau

923
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,973
What do you mean? I just don't want her

924
01:03:30,473 --> 01:03:32,309
Ain't no use even if you do, She's such a shrew

925
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,269
Where the hell are those two bastards?

926
01:03:34,936 --> 01:03:36,313
Here comes the shrew!

927
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,024
Don't go away I need your help

928
01:03:39,482 --> 01:03:40,608
You two bastards!

929
01:03:40,775 --> 01:03:43,278
Going off on your own to work
on the case without me!

930
01:03:43,653 --> 01:03:45,155
I'm going in to give them a scolding

931
01:03:45,947 --> 01:03:48,616
What? How can you say Ho Tung-See's a shrew?

932
01:03:48,783 --> 01:03:52,704
She's my dreamboat, She's a little tough

933
01:03:52,871 --> 01:03:55,290
but a real woman from top to toe

934
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:57,792
How come you don't see her gentle side

935
01:03:58,126 --> 01:04:00,879
I'm telling you, I'm crazy about her

936
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:02,881
She's a holy woman

937
01:04:03,048 --> 01:04:05,800
Did you ever see her lose her poise?

938
01:04:07,510 --> 01:04:08,970
She never gave me a harsh word

939
01:04:09,429 --> 01:04:13,058
Standing up, she's a real lady

940
01:04:15,894 --> 01:04:18,355
Sitting down, she's a precious little girl

941
01:04:18,521 --> 01:04:20,482
And she sits so demurely

942
01:04:20,940 --> 01:04:21,983
And so gentle

943
01:04:22,275 --> 01:04:24,569
If you don't believe me, ask her when she comes in

944
01:04:27,655 --> 01:04:28,573
Albert

945
01:04:30,617 --> 01:04:31,785
When did you come in?

946
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:36,956
Only just now I wanted to tell you...

947
01:04:37,123 --> 01:04:37,832
Go on!

948
01:04:39,125 --> 01:04:40,668
Tomorrow's my birthday

949
01:04:48,176 --> 01:04:49,928
Ha ha ha ha! I got you! I win

950
01:04:50,553 --> 01:04:51,763
What're you doing in here again?

951
01:04:52,305 --> 01:04:53,848
I'm just getting my jacket

952
01:05:00,397 --> 01:05:01,773
What is it?

953
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:11,366
Hi, sis

954
01:05:18,790 --> 01:05:19,707
What is it with my sister?

955
01:05:20,041 --> 01:05:21,584
I never saw her like this before

956
01:05:26,047 --> 01:05:26,923
She's okay

957
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:30,135
You just better book her a place at the nuthouse

958
01:05:31,719 --> 01:05:34,431
Hello, it's for Chai-pau

959
01:05:38,393 --> 01:05:39,727
Phone call for your sister!

960
01:05:41,521 --> 01:05:42,605
Oh, Ding-dong

961
01:05:42,772 --> 01:05:46,734
Even from outside I heard that
I have a... phone call.

962
01:05:54,576 --> 01:05:55,285
Hello

963
01:05:55,452 --> 01:05:57,662
Chai-pau, is that you? It's Squealie

964
01:05:57,829 --> 01:06:00,123
Squealie, you son of a bitch

965
01:06:00,290 --> 01:06:01,624
I told you to check out Mad Max

966
01:06:01,791 --> 01:06:03,168
where the hell were you all this time?

967
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:04,627
She'll never change

968
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,754
Still have to give her a rougher time

969
01:06:07,130 --> 01:06:07,714
What?

970
01:06:07,881 --> 01:06:10,925
He wants to kill Baldy? You tell him

971
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:13,553
if he so much as touches Baldy, I'll get him

972
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:16,306
And if I find out that you're pulling my head,

973
01:06:16,473 --> 01:06:17,807
I'll beat the shit out of you!

974
01:06:24,397 --> 01:06:26,107
Mad Max says he wants to kill you

975
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,026
I know. Now go outside

976
01:06:42,790 --> 01:06:43,708
I come to fix the toilet

977
01:06:54,719 --> 01:06:55,470
Done

978
01:07:10,151 --> 01:07:11,069
It's clogged again

979
01:07:31,798 --> 01:07:33,508
Boss. It's done

980
01:07:33,716 --> 01:07:41,975
The remote control

981
01:07:46,271 --> 01:07:49,857
I push this button and you'll be gone

982
01:07:51,776 --> 01:07:52,902
May the Lord be with you

983
01:08:03,246 --> 01:08:04,872
Hey punk! What's this hanky-panky?

984
01:08:08,459 --> 01:08:10,378
Aren't you doing the same thing on me?

985
01:08:20,597 --> 01:08:22,223
Today's Chai-pau's birthday,

986
01:08:22,390 --> 01:08:23,391
go spend some time with her

987
01:08:23,558 --> 01:08:24,183
What about you?

988
01:08:24,350 --> 01:08:26,102
I thought you two want to be alone

989
01:08:26,561 --> 01:08:27,812
The truth please

990
01:08:29,147 --> 01:08:30,398
I've a date with Ding-dong

991
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:36,904
Wow! What is it?

992
01:08:37,071 --> 01:08:39,407
It's so dark in here Has the electricity been cut?

993
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:48,166
Albert, don't you notice
anything different about me today?

994
01:08:50,543 --> 01:08:51,169
From your out-fit, I can see that

995
01:08:51,336 --> 01:08:53,921
your superiors have assigned you to work
as an undercover agent in Temple Street

996
01:08:56,591 --> 01:09:00,261
Get your leg off the couch,
you're making it all dirty

997
01:09:01,512 --> 01:09:03,097
Today's my birthday

998
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,390
So what else is new?

999
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:06,559
Let's open the champagne first

1000
01:09:32,669 --> 01:09:33,961
Who did this steak?

1001
01:09:35,338 --> 01:09:36,839
I did it myself

1002
01:09:37,215 --> 01:09:38,299
Is it your first time?

1003
01:09:38,466 --> 01:09:39,050
Yes

1004
01:09:39,300 --> 01:09:40,093
Terrible!

1005
01:09:45,932 --> 01:09:47,058
Today's your birthday?

1006
01:09:47,225 --> 01:09:47,642
Yes

1007
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,601
How old are you?

1008
01:09:49,352 --> 01:09:50,311
Thirty

1009
01:09:50,895 --> 01:09:53,147
Like a flower, congratulations!

1010
01:09:54,816 --> 01:09:57,110
Oh no. A man thirty is like a flower,

1011
01:09:57,276 --> 01:09:59,278
a woman thirty is like dregs of tea leaves

1012
01:10:01,489 --> 01:10:03,324
Why're you still single at thirty?

1013
01:10:04,367 --> 01:10:05,284
Nobody wants me

1014
01:10:05,868 --> 01:10:06,452
That's true

1015
01:10:07,245 --> 01:10:08,746
Did you hear a sound?

1016
01:10:08,913 --> 01:10:10,206
What other sounds are there
other than those you make?

1017
01:10:10,373 --> 01:10:12,083
No! Hush!

1018
01:10:12,542 --> 01:10:15,628
Tick-tock, tick-tock It's a bomb!

1019
01:10:18,798 --> 01:10:20,425
Get down! Cover your ears!

1020
01:10:22,927 --> 01:10:24,804
How come I still hear

1021
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:25,805
this tick-took, tick-took?

1022
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:29,308
Oh, it's my old watch

1023
01:10:29,684 --> 01:10:33,062
You're doing this on purpose
Are you trying to make me lose my temper?

1024
01:10:33,229 --> 01:10:34,981
It loses itself

1025
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,983
If you don't want to come back don't

1026
01:10:37,150 --> 01:10:38,443
Nobody asked you to

1027
01:10:38,735 --> 01:10:41,279
I came back because it's your birthday

1028
01:10:41,446 --> 01:10:42,864
Do you think I wanted to come back?

1029
01:10:43,072 --> 01:10:43,906
Where're you off to?

1030
01:10:44,699 --> 01:10:45,867
To have a bowlI of won-ton noodles

1031
01:10:50,538 --> 01:10:51,789
Give me a simple yes or no

1032
01:10:51,956 --> 01:10:52,582
No!

1033
01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:02,258
Nasty! I'll go if you ask one more time

1034
01:11:05,553 --> 01:11:06,554
Come on then

1035
01:11:26,824 --> 01:11:30,328
"Sweet Ding Dong, Sweeter than honey"

1036
01:11:30,578 --> 01:11:33,581
"And ever so funny"

1037
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:35,917
"I'm King Kong"

1038
01:11:36,083 --> 01:11:37,877
"A bit like James Bond"

1039
01:11:38,044 --> 01:11:40,379
"What a pair we make"

1040
01:11:41,714 --> 01:11:45,259
"You get the water, I make the coffee"

1041
01:11:45,426 --> 01:11:48,429
"I do the washing, you do the ironing"

1042
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:52,600
"I make the money, for you to spend"

1043
01:11:53,059 --> 01:11:55,186
"What a pair we make"

1044
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,565
"Any trouble you have, you can share them with me"

1045
01:12:00,107 --> 01:12:02,902
"Let's sit down and talk it over”

1046
01:12:03,653 --> 01:12:07,240
"If you need help, I'll be right here"

1047
01:12:07,573 --> 01:12:11,035
"At your beck and call"

1048
01:12:11,202 --> 01:12:14,872
"With you by my side, I'll never be afraid"

1049
01:12:15,206 --> 01:12:18,501
"United we're strong”

1050
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,503
"I'll look after you"

1051
01:12:20,795 --> 01:12:22,171
"Have no fears, rest assured”

1052
01:12:22,672 --> 01:12:25,216
"What a pair we make"

1053
01:12:36,936 --> 01:12:41,274
Chai-pau! Chai-pau!

1054
01:12:46,112 --> 01:12:49,448
"Any trouble you have, you can share them with me"

1055
01:12:49,949 --> 01:12:52,702
"Let's sit down and talk it over”

1056
01:12:53,619 --> 01:12:56,914
"If you need help, I'll be right here"

1057
01:12:57,331 --> 01:13:00,835
"At your beck and call"

1058
01:13:01,002 --> 01:13:04,672
"With you by my side, I'll never be afraid"

1059
01:13:05,006 --> 01:13:07,925
"United we're strong”

1060
01:13:08,634 --> 01:13:10,303
"I'll look after you"

1061
01:13:10,511 --> 01:13:12,013
"Don't worry"

1062
01:13:12,513 --> 01:13:14,181
"What a pair we make"

1063
01:13:14,348 --> 01:13:17,810
"That's what we are"

1064
01:13:17,977 --> 01:13:21,856
"Always a pair of aces"

1065
01:13:34,702 --> 01:13:35,286
Why so shy?

1066
01:13:35,453 --> 01:13:37,663
What's done is done Come make some coffee

1067
01:13:42,835 --> 01:13:43,753
I've found out

1068
01:13:44,003 --> 01:13:45,796
The other girl is a ballerina

1069
01:13:45,963 --> 01:13:48,257
She's leaving for Japan tomorrow

1070
01:13:48,424 --> 01:13:49,675
after the final performance at the
Academy Community Hall this evening

1071
01:13:49,842 --> 01:13:51,844
Then we'll have to move tonight

1072
01:13:53,304 --> 01:13:56,265
Wherever I am, I'm always the boss. Okay?

1073
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:57,016
Yes

1074
01:13:57,683 --> 01:13:59,018
We move night

1075
01:14:50,236 --> 01:14:50,653
Hey!

1076
01:14:50,820 --> 01:14:52,488
You two get a move on
and get the stuff over there!

1077
01:14:52,655 --> 01:14:54,156
Hey! What're you two doing here?

1078
01:14:57,410 --> 01:14:59,870
- We're...
- fans!

1079
01:15:00,037 --> 01:15:04,166
Yes, I know. Can't you read:
Backstage, no admittance!

1080
01:15:07,712 --> 01:15:09,505
Hey you two! What're you doing here?

1081
01:15:09,672 --> 01:15:11,716
You're on next

1082
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:17,179
What's this swan doing here?

1083
01:15:17,304 --> 01:15:18,639
She's an understudy (a stand-by)

1084
01:15:18,806 --> 01:15:20,641
Yes I know. A stand-by, to stand by the backstage

1085
01:15:20,808 --> 01:15:22,351
Get moving, you're on

1086
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,145
You two're in the wrong costume

1087
01:15:24,687 --> 01:15:27,189
Ah! You again!

1088
01:15:27,481 --> 01:15:29,358
Impostors! Impostors!

1089
01:15:29,525 --> 01:15:31,027
Get them! Quick! Get them! Ah!

1090
01:15:54,175 --> 01:15:55,342
Wow! What's going on?

1091
01:15:58,846 --> 01:16:02,141
Quick! Over there!

1092
01:16:02,516 --> 01:16:04,769
We're on next! We're on next! Hurry!

1093
01:16:32,379 --> 01:16:33,255
Hey director, you can't throw in stuff

1094
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,715
just like that even you've won
the Golden Horse Award

1095
01:16:34,882 --> 01:16:37,551
What do you mean? He just barged in

1096
01:16:44,683 --> 01:16:45,392
Stay right here!

1097
01:16:46,811 --> 01:16:48,687
Carry him backstage, quick

1098
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,481
Carry him backstage!

1099
01:16:56,278 --> 01:17:00,491
What're you going? Let me go! Let me go!

1100
01:17:02,576 --> 01:17:04,286
Hey! Let me go! That's the one!

1101
01:17:04,411 --> 01:17:06,288
Hey Baldy! Here I come!

1102
01:17:12,169 --> 01:17:12,711
Get her!

1103
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:14,380
Ma!

1104
01:17:15,589 --> 01:17:17,591
Not that one! Let me go!

1105
01:17:18,551 --> 01:17:19,218
Sorry

1106
01:17:20,052 --> 01:17:20,594
This one?

1107
01:17:20,761 --> 01:17:21,554
Right! That's the one

1108
01:17:36,485 --> 01:17:37,653
Oh no, what's going on?

1109
01:17:39,780 --> 01:17:40,906
Great! Great!

1110
01:17:41,740 --> 01:17:43,159
The audience like it!

1111
01:17:43,325 --> 01:17:45,161
I'm going to get another award

1112
01:18:00,092 --> 01:18:01,969
Great! Excellent!

1113
01:18:03,220 --> 01:18:04,138
Go back on!

1114
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:05,055
Go on!

1115
01:18:05,222 --> 01:18:07,516
Go, go, go

1116
01:18:16,901 --> 01:18:20,487
Nancy, come back Nancy! Nancy!

1117
01:18:26,660 --> 01:18:28,204
Curtain call! Quick!

1118
01:18:29,955 --> 01:18:31,498
Bring the curtain down! Bring the curtain down!

1119
01:18:38,797 --> 01:18:39,715
That's the light bridge

1120
01:18:39,882 --> 01:18:40,591
Get it back up!

1121
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:41,634
Sorry, sorry

1122
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:43,946
What're you doing?

1123
01:19:44,113 --> 01:19:49,076
If you got to change,
then get on with it! Over there!

1124
01:19:58,794 --> 01:19:59,795
What're you looking at!

1125
01:20:17,479 --> 01:20:18,439
Cheers!

1126
01:20:21,567 --> 01:20:23,777
According to my analysis,

1127
01:20:24,653 --> 01:20:26,238
these two hearts are the clues
that Joe left when he died

1128
01:20:26,405 --> 01:20:29,241
Take away the hearts

1129
01:20:29,491 --> 01:20:30,701
and what's left is this bunch of words

1130
01:20:31,118 --> 01:20:33,454
Knowing Joe's life-long affection for perversion,

1131
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:34,830
we'll read them accordingly

1132
01:20:36,749 --> 01:20:38,167
The first line reads MAP

1133
01:20:38,334 --> 01:20:39,043
A map

1134
01:20:39,209 --> 01:20:39,960
Good boy

1135
01:20:40,419 --> 01:20:41,587
Hmm, Joe kept saying Kowloon

1136
01:20:41,754 --> 01:20:43,088
when he died

1137
01:20:43,339 --> 01:20:45,591
So now we'll look at a map of Kowloon

1138
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:55,642
The second line reads P6. p6

1139
01:20:58,771 --> 01:20:59,480
The sea

1140
01:20:59,730 --> 01:21:00,314
Right!

1141
01:21:00,731 --> 01:21:03,442
And what does the final clue B3 stands for?

1142
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:04,526
What?

1143
01:21:06,153 --> 01:21:07,071
You won't guess it

1144
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:12,117
I found it! That's B3 right here

1145
01:21:12,284 --> 01:21:13,160
Good boy!

1146
01:21:13,327 --> 01:21:16,121
So your partner Joe has brains, eh?

1147
01:21:16,288 --> 01:21:16,830
A bit like you

1148
01:21:16,997 --> 01:21:19,249
So the diamonds must be under the buoy

1149
01:21:19,416 --> 01:21:20,167
Naturally

1150
01:21:22,336 --> 01:21:23,921
No! I can't swim

1151
01:21:24,088 --> 01:21:24,797
Neither can I

1152
01:21:24,963 --> 01:21:26,632
Then I'll give you lessons

1153
01:21:29,176 --> 01:21:29,718
See, you're doing fine

1154
01:21:29,885 --> 01:21:31,178
You international crook!

1155
01:21:42,314 --> 01:21:44,358
I've got it!

1156
01:21:59,498 --> 01:22:01,125
Stop! After them!

1157
01:22:01,291 --> 01:22:03,794
Don't bother. Those are fake ones
The real ones are here

1158
01:22:03,961 --> 01:22:05,504
Ah! Clever boy!

1159
01:22:14,888 --> 01:22:16,223
Damn Baldy!

1160
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:26,066
You come just in time. Here are the diamonds

1161
01:22:26,233 --> 01:22:26,984
I'm clean

1162
01:22:27,151 --> 01:22:27,734
Sure thing

1163
01:22:28,861 --> 01:22:30,028
What are you doing here?

1164
01:22:30,571 --> 01:22:32,239
I brought you your car

1165
01:22:32,406 --> 01:22:33,615
Don't get in the way

1166
01:22:33,740 --> 01:22:35,659
White glove won't turn up

1167
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:36,743
if he smells you cops

1168
01:22:37,369 --> 01:22:38,245
Call me if anything happens

1169
01:22:38,412 --> 01:22:40,122
I've got the whole force ready

1170
01:22:40,998 --> 01:22:41,874
Okay, okay. Now scram

1171
01:22:42,040 --> 01:22:43,292
And run a hot bath for me

1172
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:44,084
Yes

1173
01:22:47,171 --> 01:22:51,425
Albert, put on some clothes or you'll catch a cold

1174
01:22:53,260 --> 01:22:56,430
Don't kid me, you just want to keep
watch over me. See what you can do!

1175
01:23:02,102 --> 01:23:02,644
Are you ready?

1176
01:23:02,811 --> 01:23:03,854
Yes, yes

1177
01:23:17,701 --> 01:23:19,661
Didn't you say you've set a dragnet?

1178
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:20,746
Can you tell me about it now?

1179
01:23:21,121 --> 01:23:22,581
You can't give away God's design

1180
01:23:22,956 --> 01:23:24,625
Anyway it's either you or him this time

1181
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:25,667
What about you?

1182
01:23:25,876 --> 01:23:27,294
I'll watch

1183
01:23:36,428 --> 01:23:39,973
That's White Glove, the bastard. Hurry, hurry!

1184
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:02,079
I think it's him and not you
who'll have it this time

1185
01:24:05,123 --> 01:24:07,584
It's not fair to him, us two against him one

1186
01:24:08,001 --> 01:24:09,545
Give you a chance to show off yourself, Baldy

1187
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:10,504
What about you?

1188
01:24:10,837 --> 01:24:12,839
I'm saving myself for the grand occasion

1189
01:24:13,006 --> 01:24:13,507
Hmm

1190
01:24:35,279 --> 01:24:36,863
Here's a grand occasion for you

1191
01:24:37,030 --> 01:24:38,824
Good. This time we'll round them up at one swoop

1192
01:24:39,074 --> 01:24:40,534
Now get the army

1193
01:24:40,701 --> 01:24:41,827
What army?

1194
01:24:42,035 --> 01:24:43,245
Get out the paging machine and call Chai-pau

1195
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:44,246
I threw that damn thing away

1196
01:24:44,413 --> 01:24:45,038
What?

1197
01:24:45,289 --> 01:24:47,165
What! You said you've set a dragnet

1198
01:24:47,332 --> 01:24:48,875
Yes, but it ain't here

1199
01:24:49,042 --> 01:24:49,543
What!

1200
01:25:24,077 --> 01:25:25,245
Oh no! No! You're just useless

1201
01:25:25,412 --> 01:25:27,664
- Let me take the wheel
- Cut it out!

1202
01:25:30,000 --> 01:25:31,251
Hey hey! Watch out watch out!

1203
01:25:34,338 --> 01:25:35,380
Stay put! Let me do it!

1204
01:25:37,924 --> 01:25:41,470
Stop the car! Stop stop! Put in reverse! Reverse!

1205
01:25:44,681 --> 01:25:47,267
Ah surrender. He surrenders, he surrenders!

1206
01:25:58,820 --> 01:25:59,821
You're as bad as your car,

1207
01:26:00,364 --> 01:26:02,991
all looks and nothing else

1208
01:26:03,742 --> 01:26:05,702
Keep quiet and eat the pineapple

1209
01:26:08,747 --> 01:26:09,289
Hey there

1210
01:26:09,456 --> 01:26:10,707
Good boy!

1211
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:26,973
You're doing okay, kiddo

1212
01:26:43,865 --> 01:26:46,243
I see a lot of stars

1213
01:26:46,535 --> 01:26:47,244
Are you okay?

1214
01:26:47,411 --> 01:26:47,661
I'm okay

1215
01:26:47,828 --> 01:26:49,663
Let's get over there, quick

1216
01:26:54,710 --> 01:26:55,252
What's this?

1217
01:26:55,419 --> 01:26:55,961
Digging for cover

1218
01:26:56,128 --> 01:26:56,586
Good idea

1219
01:27:01,967 --> 01:27:02,634
What's this?

1220
01:27:02,884 --> 01:27:04,052
The dragnet

1221
01:27:57,230 --> 01:27:58,231
Ha, this is fun

1222
01:27:58,398 --> 01:27:59,232
Careful now

1223
01:28:17,751 --> 01:28:18,752
Let me have a go

1224
01:28:18,919 --> 01:28:19,669
Go away

1225
01:28:32,474 --> 01:28:33,975
There's still one of them

1226
01:28:36,520 --> 01:28:36,895
Let me do it!

1227
01:28:37,062 --> 01:28:37,896
Get off!

1228
01:28:49,241 --> 01:28:51,243
Haha, you're quite smart

1229
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:52,828
Of course

1230

Are you alright?

1231
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,126
I'm fine

1232
01:29:03,129 --> 01:29:04,214
But I'm not

Are you okay?

1234
01:30:39,726 --> 01:30:43,772
Help! I can't swim

1235
01:30:50,612 --> 01:30:51,237
What's going on?

1236
01:30:51,404 --> 01:30:53,782
Move on, move on

1237
01:30:56,326 --> 01:30:57,118
Let's break this up

1238
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:58,578
How is he now?

1239
01:30:58,787 --> 01:31:00,246
Break it up Nothing to see
