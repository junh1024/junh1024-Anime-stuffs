Building sign: Tsim Sha Tsui Centre

1
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,165
Thank you.

2
00:03:31,937 --> 00:03:33,126
A grenade!

3
00:04:04,968 --> 00:04:06,157
Bye-bye.

4
00:04:19,682 --> 00:04:24,342
I'm sorry, the lift is broken.
Bye-bye.

5
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,279
Don't move!

6
00:04:37,099 --> 00:04:43,761
That way! Oi! Hurry!
Over there!

7
00:04:53,281 --> 00:04:54,469
What are you doing?

8
00:04:55,249 --> 00:04:58,441
I'm fixing the front, no, the tyre.

9
00:05:01,822 --> 00:05:04,718
Now, your bike's real fast. Faster than the wind.

10
00:05:12,333 --> 00:05:13,591
If I didn't promise your late father
I'd look after you,

11
00:05:13,601 --> 00:05:14,700
I'd have thrown you into the big blue ocean!

12
00:05:14,701 --> 00:05:15,634
I'm sorry.

13
00:05:15,635 --> 00:05:16,602
What's next?

14
00:05:16,603 --> 00:05:17,769
The plane.
- What?

15
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:19,403
The yacht.
- What?

16
00:05:19,572 --> 00:05:21,967
Oh, no, the glider.

17
00:05:22,108 --> 00:05:23,297
Hurry up then.

18
00:05:24,377 --> 00:05:25,635
The glider...

19
00:05:26,212 --> 00:05:27,504
Hurry up!

20
00:05:47,799 --> 00:05:48,988
Bye-bye...

20
00:06:27,20 --> 00:06:35,50
Temporary Sign: Road works

21
00:09:25,106 --> 00:09:27,965
Roberto! Nice to see you again!
- Oh, Monty!

22
00:09:28,872 --> 00:09:31,199
Welcome home!
- Hey, Monty!

23
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,294
Had a nice time in Hong Kong?
- No.

24
00:09:33,295 --> 00:09:35,281
Godfather is not happy.
- Me too...

25
00:09:35,282 --> 00:09:37,162
He's waiting for you.
Good luck, my boy.

26
00:09:37,163 --> 00:09:38,740
Thank you, thank you.

27
00:09:47,994 --> 00:09:49,183
Don Antonio...

28
00:09:51,631 --> 00:09:53,455
Go to your mother...

29
00:09:55,768 --> 00:09:57,635
Monty, my boy!

30
00:09:58,704 --> 00:10:00,667
I'm sorry, godfather.

31
00:10:02,007 --> 00:10:04,871
You are sorry?
What's the matter with you?

32
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:06,802
What's the matter with you?

33
00:10:07,446 --> 00:10:08,713
Eh, this guy...

34
00:10:08,714 --> 00:10:13,813
Every time you make mistake you come back to me,
and give me a lot of bullshit.

35
00:10:13,952 --> 00:10:18,110
Now, tell me, who did it? Huh?

36
00:10:18,723 --> 00:10:20,015
White Gloves.

37
00:10:21,225 --> 00:10:25,325
It's him? Where is he now?

38
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,788
He's in Venice!

39
00:10:37,073 --> 00:10:39,332
So I believe you, my boy.

40
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:42,137
I'm never lying to you, godfather.

41
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,813
No matter how, you go to Hong Kong
and get me the diamonds.

42
00:10:47,584 --> 00:10:48,773
Why me?

43
00:10:50,086 --> 00:10:53,483
You do so,
or you'll be a dead fish!

44
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,187
Use my connections in Hong Kong.

45
00:10:56,592 --> 00:11:01,396
I can lose the diamonds,
but I cannot lose the Italian's face.

46
00:11:01,397 --> 00:11:02,430
Capeesh?

47
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,723
But I'm a British!

48
00:11:03,933 --> 00:11:10,772
Stupid!
You still don't know, British and Italians are cousins?

49
00:11:10,773 --> 00:11:11,962
I've never heard of it.

50
00:11:13,375 --> 00:11:15,269
Diamonds, or your life!

51
00:11:35,979 --> 00:11:38,875
Sir, according to our investigation...

52
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:40,071
Wait...

53
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:45,013
Englishman here. Don't need to speak English. Chinese is fine too.

54
00:11:45,052 --> 00:11:46,970
Mr. Hua, please speak.
- Oh.

55
00:11:47,191 --> 00:11:51,122
Recently at Tsim Sha Tsui Centre,
a major robbery took place.

56
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:56,090
A valuable consignment of diamonds
was robbed, but was not reported.

57
00:11:56,199 --> 00:11:58,526
Let's look at the information we've gathered

58
00:12:07,677 --> 00:12:13,315
This is a local gangster. He's called Szeto Buren, who specializes in stolen goods.

59
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:19,618
This is the leader of an international
smuggling syndicate.

60
00:12:19,721 --> 00:12:22,788
An Italian called Montesotto.

61
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:27,722
Szeto didn't lose anything in the robbery

62
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,858
and the Italian didn't report any loss
to the police either.

63
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:38,002
The only thing left at the scene of the crime,
was a white glove.

64
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:42,571
Our #1 piece of information, is a blank.

65
00:12:43,811 --> 00:12:48,004
The source of the previous information is Squealie,

66
00:12:48,215 --> 00:12:52,579
an undercover agent from us. So we cannot reveal more than his nickname.

67
00:12:52,787 --> 00:12:54,385
His name is Nick!

68
00:12:54,387 --> 00:12:57,522
SILENCE! Don't ruin the atmosphere.

69
00:12:57,657 --> 00:13:02,556
This is the world-famous burglar.
He's called White Glove.

70
00:13:02,796 --> 00:13:04,930
He specializes in stealing diamonds and gold.

71
00:13:05,098 --> 00:13:08,461
He has 7 passports, 8 surnames,

72
00:13:08,501 --> 00:13:12,262
9 identities and 2 sexes.

73
00:13:13,106 --> 00:13:15,432
When he came to Hong Kong,

74
00:13:15,607 --> 00:13:18,537
you could say that it's a blessing for the Hong Kong people.

75
00:13:18,877 --> 00:13:22,740
You could also say it's a blight for the Hong Kong people.

76
00:13:23,115 --> 00:13:27,752
So, we need to think of a way, to find his arch enemies, and do battle.

77
00:13:27,786 --> 00:13:28,953
Arch enemies?

78
00:13:28,954 --> 00:13:32,180
Right, he has two.

79
00:13:32,458 --> 00:13:35,820
The 1st is the Pink Panther, Peter Sellers.

80
00:13:36,027 --> 00:13:38,286
But he is no longer with us.

81
00:13:38,696 --> 00:13:41,364
The 2nd is the ...

82
00:13:41,365 --> 00:13:42,554
Hey, you're in the way!

83
00:13:42,967 --> 00:13:45,192
Detective Baldy from the states.

84
00:13:45,436 --> 00:13:49,936
Due to White Glove, he went from full bloom to full barren.

85
00:13:49,974 --> 00:13:54,633
From hairy, to baldy.


86
00:13:54,678 --> 00:13:57,506
His boss says, if he doesn't catch White Glove
within 3 months,

87
00:13:57,614 --> 00:14:01,682
he'll be on his pension
and washing dishes in his hometown.

88
00:14:03,887 --> 00:14:07,420
So, we'll organize to invite Detective Baldy to Hong Kong

89
00:14:07,491 --> 00:14:10,922
since he is most keen on
catching White Glove.

90
00:14:10,961 --> 00:14:16,894
Also, we'll be assigning this year's most outstanding young policewoman, Superintendent Ho Tung-sze...

91
00:14:16,966 --> 00:14:18,360
That tiger?

92
00:14:18,801 --> 00:14:23,165
...to team up with Detective Baldy on this case.

93
00:14:23,172 --> 00:14:25,670
Excellent idea!

94
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,375
Hey bro, got a lighter?

95
00:14:36,317 --> 00:14:37,745
Wow, it's a babe!

96
00:14:39,187 --> 00:14:40,979
A babe will definitely have a lighter.

97
00:14:41,055 --> 00:14:42,347
She's a little overdressed though.

98
00:14:44,659 --> 00:14:46,656
All the more satisfying to undress hah!

99
00:14:49,297 --> 00:14:50,555
You wanna look at something?

100
00:14:50,565 --> 00:14:51,823
Of course!

101
00:14:53,167 --> 00:14:54,697
Don't blink!

102
00:14:55,369 --> 00:14:58,436
Now, here! Light, light, light.

103
00:14:58,472 --> 00:15:01,402
I'll light your butt when my gun goes off!

104
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:04,743
It's all his fault! Not me! Miss, we'll leave you next time!

105
00:15:06,346 --> 00:15:09,447
Let's go! You pull this shit every day!

106
00:15:09,449 --> 00:15:11,514
You're dissing me? I'm better than you! Of course a babe will have a... Go!

107
00:15:16,422 --> 00:15:19,090
What you lookin' at? Never seen a woman's thighs before?

108
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,158
I was just looking at your holster.

109
00:15:21,394 --> 00:15:23,789
Officer Ho, are you going to pick up Detective Baldy?

110
00:15:23,996 --> 00:15:27,029
Like hell I have time to pick him up, I'm here
to look for Squealie, the informer.

111
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:29,367
So many people here, how can find him?

112
00:15:29,602 --> 00:15:33,635
Watch closely. When I say the word, he'll come out.

113
00:15:34,105 --> 00:15:35,704
Squealie!

114
00:15:35,707 --> 00:15:37,341
He's not here!

115
00:15:37,342 --> 00:15:38,839
Hold it right there!

116
00:15:40,045 --> 00:15:41,371
Gotta run.

117
00:15:41,913 --> 00:15:43,102
Still running?

118
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:07,759
Don't run!

119
00:16:17,513 --> 00:16:19,571
Come on, get down.

120
00:16:20,617 --> 00:16:24,548
There's nobody here! Don't take it so seriously.

121
00:16:25,521 --> 00:16:28,918
I'm covering for you. Got any info?

122
00:16:29,359 --> 00:16:32,323
Sure, three pieces... two good
and one bad.

123
00:16:33,829 --> 00:16:35,553
Give me the two good ones then.

124
00:16:36,698 --> 00:16:39,767
Good: Detective Baldy is arriving from the States today.

125
00:16:39,768 --> 00:16:41,731
You've been assigned to work with him.

126
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,330
How come you know our stuff too?

127
00:16:43,472 --> 00:16:45,697
How else can I be an informer?

128
00:16:46,074 --> 00:16:47,263
What else?

129
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:50,841
Also, there's going to be a robbery today,
in Kowloon, at the Chow Tai Fok Jewellery shop

130
00:16:50,912 --> 00:16:52,101
How did you know it's today?

131
00:16:52,280 --> 00:16:54,941
I picked the day for them.

132
00:16:55,249 --> 00:16:56,438
Huh? Today's a good day?

133
00:16:58,085 --> 00:17:00,109
No, it's a bad day

134
00:17:02,123 --> 00:17:03,312
Oi! What about bad one?

135
00:17:03,824 --> 00:17:06,686
Bad: Your boss said you wouldn't be
at the airport today.

136
00:17:06,761 --> 00:17:08,656
He told me to do my rounds here.

137
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:12,157
I'd never thought I'd run into you
Rotten luck, eh?


138
00:17:16,803 --> 00:17:17,836
It's arrived.

139
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:21,073
It's arrived? Why not wait for him?
I have to go check a case.

140
00:17:21,074 --> 00:17:22,107
What case?

141
00:17:22,108 --> 00:17:24,503
None of your business. A big case.

142
00:17:41,894 --> 00:17:43,584
Wind against Water,
- Snow against Wind,

143
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,759
White against Red,
- Four Great Happiness,

144
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,693
Young husband,
- Losing is tough,

145
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:49,127
Winning is fun

146
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:51,930
I'm called Chan Pak-keung (Danny Chan)

147
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:53,767
I'm called Au Shui-Keung (Albert Au)

148
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:56,130
That's a fake name.

149
00:17:56,874 --> 00:17:58,439
Mine too.

150
00:18:08,953 --> 00:18:12,884
Hey boss, you're going to be robbed soon.

151
00:18:13,224 --> 00:18:15,157
But fear not, I'm here...

152
00:18:15,158 --> 00:18:22,230
It's a robbery! Don't move! Get away!
What are you doing? Get down on the floor!

153
00:18:24,735 --> 00:18:26,732
Stand in the corner. Hurry!

154
00:18:28,271 --> 00:18:30,166
Hey, Fill it up! Chop-chop!

155
00:18:34,009 --> 00:18:37,872
Attention all units, alarm at the
Kowloon Chow Tai Fok Jewellery shop.

156
00:18:37,913 --> 00:18:39,842
Can you check it out?

157
00:18:41,050 --> 00:18:42,308
Where's Chow Tai Fok Jewellery shop?

158
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:43,384
Just around the corner.

159
00:18:43,385 --> 00:18:44,574
Let's go...

160
00:18:45,621 --> 00:18:47,021
Boss, we're ready.

161
00:18:47,022 --> 00:18:49,087
Go get a car, don't move!

162
00:18:55,396 --> 00:18:56,585
Don't move!

163
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:59,699
Get back in, or I'll blow your head off!

164
00:19:02,670 --> 00:19:03,859
Don't move!

165
00:19:04,239 --> 00:19:05,405
Boss, we're finished!

166
00:19:05,406 --> 00:19:06,595
Don't follow us, eh?

167
00:19:11,346 --> 00:19:12,535
Move it!

168
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:25,415
Oi! A police officer now requisitions use of your car!

169
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,159
The key?

170
00:19:33,166 --> 00:19:34,731
Right here... Ha ha ha!

171
00:19:38,204 --> 00:19:40,872
Step on it!

172
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:43,237
It's hard to be slow but it's easy to be fast!

173
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:04,826
You trynna kill us?
- What if they report us?
- Watch it!
- Just drive!

174
00:20:10,669 --> 00:20:13,536
Do you know how to drive, Baldhead? You aren't dead yet?

175
00:20:13,537 --> 00:20:15,205
Accident! Accident!
!!==upto

176
00:20:15,206 --> 00:20:19,570
Let's get going!

177
00:20:22,947 --> 00:20:25,547
How did you get your driver's licence?

178
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,326
Out! Police!

179
00:21:17,899 --> 00:21:20,590
So am I, pal.

180
00:21:20,902 --> 00:21:23,270
Don't try to kid me.

181
00:21:23,271 --> 00:21:24,437
Are you an illegal immigrant?

182
00:21:24,438 --> 00:21:25,627
Oh, no.

183
00:21:26,574 --> 00:21:29,641
You can get this in any flea market.

184
00:21:32,613 --> 00:21:36,714
Hey, I caught the whole gang for you! See?

185
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:52,353
Get in!

186
00:21:57,770 --> 00:22:01,497
Move. Sit down.

187
00:22:08,681 --> 00:22:10,280
Who's the boss?

188
00:22:10,382 --> 00:22:11,879
Him.

189
00:22:12,885 --> 00:22:15,218
Take their statement.

190
00:22:15,219 --> 00:22:16,153
Get up!

191
00:22:16,154 --> 00:22:17,514
Come with me.

192
00:22:20,091 --> 00:22:21,280
Move.

193
00:22:22,660 --> 00:22:23,694
Sit down.

194
00:22:23,695 --> 00:22:25,294
OK, thanks.

195
00:22:29,033 --> 00:22:30,222
Over there!

196
00:22:30,568 --> 00:22:32,133
Anything you say...

197
00:22:37,841 --> 00:22:39,633
Didn't make it this time!

198
00:22:39,977 --> 00:22:41,844
Are you familiar with Hong Kong Law?

199
00:22:41,845 --> 00:22:45,310
No, but I know all about U.S. Law.

200
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:48,447
New in town, eh? When did you arrive?

201
00:22:48,752 --> 00:22:49,941
Just today.

202
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,882
How did you get through the border?
Did you swim?

203
00:22:51,922 --> 00:22:53,821
I flew.

204
00:22:53,823 --> 00:22:54,923
Any relatives here?

205
00:22:54,924 --> 00:22:57,024
None. No friends either.

206
00:22:57,059 --> 00:22:58,293
There's only one person in Hong Kong
who knows me.

207
00:22:58,294 --> 00:22:59,194
Who might that be?

208
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,384
The Governor.

209
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:04,932
He invited me here.

210
00:23:05,701 --> 00:23:07,459
Very smart!

211
00:23:08,037 --> 00:23:10,569
You have the right to remain silent,

212
00:23:10,906 --> 00:23:12,040
anything you say...

213
00:23:12,041 --> 00:23:14,333
... may be used against you in court. Right?

214
00:23:17,912 --> 00:23:19,013
Your name?

215
00:23:19,014 --> 00:23:21,307
Call me Albert Au.

216
00:23:22,951 --> 00:23:26,120
You even have an English name! Huh! From?

217
00:23:26,121 --> 00:23:27,154
Taishan.

218
00:23:27,155 --> 00:23:28,188
Marital status?

219
00:23:28,189 --> 00:23:29,754
Single. And you?

220
00:23:29,824 --> 00:23:32,356
None of your business!
Sex?

221
00:23:32,527 --> 00:23:34,125
Madam, please note, I have a moustache.

222
00:23:34,161 --> 00:23:35,194
So what does that prove?

223
00:23:35,195 --> 00:23:36,623
Only men have moustaches.

224
00:23:36,864 --> 00:23:40,693
Not like you.

225
00:23:40,768 --> 00:23:44,426
I still can't figure out your real sex.

226
00:23:46,473 --> 00:23:47,662
Don't you dare!

227
00:23:49,109 --> 00:23:50,640
Your hit me before I even touched you?

228
00:23:51,612 --> 00:23:52,800
Don't move!

229
00:23:53,446 --> 00:23:55,739
Good, very good.

230
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:00,819
Great to see you in action, Kodojak.

231
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,284
Nothing to it. She's even better.

232
00:24:03,956 --> 00:24:08,092
Naturally. Superintendent Ho has a
reputation for efficiency,

233
00:24:08,094 --> 00:24:10,159
but she's a little slow with her gun.

234
00:24:10,797 --> 00:24:15,599
I've arranged for her to assist you
on this case.

235
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:17,529
Her! No, thanks!

236
00:24:17,702 --> 00:24:23,140
As cover, you two will pose as a
married couple.

237
00:24:23,141 --> 00:24:24,831
What? Him as my husband?

238
00:24:25,243 --> 00:24:28,776
With his looks, I'd rather have a gorilla.

239
00:24:29,381 --> 00:24:32,383
Looking for trouble, bitch! Are the
hotel rooms booked yet?

240
00:24:32,384 --> 00:24:33,416
Sure thing!

241
00:24:33,417 --> 00:24:37,587
Get her a room next to mine
with an adjoining door.

242
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:38,777
Wishful thinking!

243
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,558
You're not scared of him, are you?

244
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,456
I just don't like hotels.
We'll stay at my place.

245
00:24:45,529 --> 00:24:46,563
Your place?

246
00:24:46,564 --> 00:24:47,464
Are you chicken?

247
00:24:47,465 --> 00:24:51,101
Why should I be?

248
00:24:54,704 --> 00:24:57,304
Don't think of me as a woman.

249
00:24:57,407 --> 00:24:59,541
They all treat me like a man downtown.

250
00:25:00,076 --> 00:25:04,203
Don't you ever forget, we are only
pretending to be married.

251
00:25:05,815 --> 00:25:10,782
Oh, come on, I've seen it all before.

252
00:25:15,624 --> 00:25:17,851
According to Squealie...

253
00:25:17,926 --> 00:25:21,896
... the diamond job was done by him, King Kong,

254
00:25:21,897 --> 00:25:24,232
also known as Superman.

255
00:25:24,233 --> 00:25:26,867
He has a partner Gigolo Joe...

256
00:25:26,935 --> 00:25:30,036
... who's always surrounded by women.

257
00:25:30,239 --> 00:25:32,532
He's tattooed with all of their phone numbers.

258
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:35,637
After the job, they both disappeared.

259
00:25:35,843 --> 00:25:38,170
King Kong lives on the 5th floor.

260
00:26:02,903 --> 00:26:04,837
King Kong. Joe here.

261
00:26:04,838 --> 00:26:05,504
Use the code!

262
00:26:05,505 --> 00:26:08,640
Oh, sorry! Minnie Mouse
calling Mickey, over.

263
00:26:08,742 --> 00:26:10,341
Mickey here. Go ahead.

264
00:26:10,710 --> 00:26:13,444
I've hidden the diamonds...

265
00:26:13,445 --> 00:26:14,312
The code! The code!

266
00:26:14,313 --> 00:26:17,812
Oh sorry. I've hidden the peanuts...

267
00:26:18,651 --> 00:26:21,149
Don't tell me. I talk in my sleep.

268
00:26:21,153 --> 00:26:25,790
I know that, but I have to tell you.

269
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:26,980
Why?

270
00:26:27,293 --> 00:26:29,518
Because I just did it with
Mad Max's sister.

271
00:26:30,095 --> 00:26:32,490
You must be crazy!
Max will come after you.

272
00:26:32,597 --> 00:26:35,061
I know. That's why I have to tell you.

273
00:26:35,066 --> 00:26:36,290
OK... where?

274
00:26:36,434 --> 00:26:38,826
Oh, no! I can't tell you where.
Bugs, remember?

275
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:41,134
How will I know where to go then?

276
00:26:45,143 --> 00:26:47,504
That's true. I'll whisper.

277
00:26:49,747 --> 00:26:51,344
I can't hear you.

278
00:26:51,382 --> 00:26:55,815
Seventh Heaven. Got that?

279
00:27:03,026 --> 00:27:05,524
Better get to Seventh Heaven quickly.

280
00:27:06,763 --> 00:27:10,592
Give the peanuts to him, quick!

281
00:27:10,734 --> 00:27:13,163
No, it's diamonds.

282
00:27:16,839 --> 00:27:18,472
It's him!

283
00:27:33,922 --> 00:27:36,181
It's White Glove! Get him.

284
00:27:38,727 --> 00:27:39,793
King Kong.

285
00:27:39,794 --> 00:27:40,983
Oh, no! It's her!

286
00:27:42,697 --> 00:27:44,125
Stay right there!

287
00:27:44,399 --> 00:27:46,965
Not that one, the other one!

288
00:28:10,157 --> 00:28:11,517
You want me dead?

289
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,153
Better take some driving lessons first.

290
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,428
You bastard.

291
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,228
Bye-bye, Baldy!

292
00:28:51,229 --> 00:28:57,025
Don't you dare drive off...
I'll catch you!

293
00:29:04,208 --> 00:29:06,433
Hold it right there. White Glove!

294
00:29:22,325 --> 00:29:23,753
Stop, Police!

295
00:29:28,665 --> 00:29:31,129
Hi! Hey!

296
00:29:33,602 --> 00:29:34,928
Bye-bye!

297
00:29:36,505 --> 00:29:37,865
Stop!

298
00:29:56,457 --> 00:29:58,091
A table for how many?

299
00:29:58,392 --> 00:30:00,154
I'll help myself, thank you.

300
00:30:00,395 --> 00:30:01,584
I'm over here!

301
00:30:07,101 --> 00:30:11,770
The diamonds, no, I mean, the peanuts...
are very well hidden.

302
00:30:11,839 --> 00:30:15,530
I've tattooed the clue
on 2 different women.

303
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:18,837
Go on, don't be so nervous.

304
00:30:18,945 --> 00:30:22,637
You know how it is in the movies.
The informer usually gets killed

305
00:30:22,682 --> 00:30:24,611
before he can finish talking.

306
00:30:25,452 --> 00:30:28,411
I'm not worried, the one listening
always lives.

307
00:30:29,055 --> 00:30:30,344
Spit it out.

308
00:30:31,024 --> 00:30:33,589
The diamonds...

309
00:30:34,693 --> 00:30:35,794
Yes?

310
00:30:35,795 --> 00:30:37,724
Can't you see I've been shot?

311
00:30:40,032 --> 00:30:43,599
It's only the champagne! Get on with it.

312
00:30:45,671 --> 00:30:48,863
Let's go to the washroom.

313
00:30:53,511 --> 00:30:54,812
Alright, you can talk now.

314
00:30:54,813 --> 00:30:56,002
Hurry.

315
00:30:56,314 --> 00:30:58,095
I hid the diamonds...

316
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:01,451
... I mean, the peanuts, in Kowloon.

317
00:31:01,485 --> 00:31:02,486
Wait, hush.

318
00:31:02,587 --> 00:31:03,576
Why?

319
00:31:03,588 --> 00:31:07,656
I'm deaf, I can't hear anything.

320
00:31:08,660 --> 00:31:11,158
He's a mute, he didn't say anything.

321
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:17,733
What?

322
00:31:17,734 --> 00:31:18,923
Mad Max!

323
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:22,138
I'm a dead man now.

324
00:31:22,139 --> 00:31:23,328
Let's get out through the back.

325
00:31:32,949 --> 00:31:34,138
In here.

326
00:31:38,888 --> 00:31:40,282
Go on, nobody is in here.

327
00:31:40,323 --> 00:31:45,051
The peanuts... wait... isn't this lift
kind of small?

328
00:31:48,798 --> 00:31:53,058
Watch it to your right.

329
00:31:53,668 --> 00:31:56,462
Excuse us.

330
00:32:04,312 --> 00:32:05,774
It's OK they don't speak Chinese.

331
00:32:05,847 --> 00:32:07,344
How can you be so sure!

332
00:32:07,349 --> 00:32:08,538
Right!

333
00:32:10,685 --> 00:32:13,820
I know, we'll speak in code.

334
00:32:13,821 --> 00:32:15,579
Use Planguage and mumbo jumbo.

335
00:32:15,589 --> 00:32:16,723
What's that?!

336
00:32:16,724 --> 00:32:18,858
Repeat each syllable and add a 'P' first.

337
00:32:18,859 --> 00:32:20,048
Get on with it then!

338
00:32:20,728 --> 00:32:23,692
The (per) pea (pee) nuts (puts) are (par)
in (pin) Kow (pow) loon (poon)

339
00:32:24,098 --> 00:32:25,287
What did you say?

340
00:32:25,466 --> 00:32:28,100
The peanuts are in Kowloon.

341
00:32:30,871 --> 00:32:33,163
Ex (pix) cuse (puse) me (pe)

342
00:32:33,239 --> 00:32:35,430
Excuse me.

343
00:32:39,379 --> 00:32:41,103
Even a kid can do it.

344
00:32:42,782 --> 00:32:43,971
There's nobody in the lift now.

345
00:32:46,219 --> 00:32:48,216
Hang on.

346
00:32:48,454 --> 00:32:49,643
In there.

347
00:33:19,550 --> 00:33:28,590
I'm up here, I'm scared like hell.

348
00:33:28,726 --> 00:33:32,258
But remember 'Rose'!

349
00:33:32,262 --> 00:33:37,433
What rose?! Forget it, are you OK?

350
00:33:37,434 --> 00:33:40,202
Can't you see for yourself?!

351
00:33:40,203 --> 00:33:44,473
I'm sorry for all the things I did!

352
00:33:44,474 --> 00:33:45,766
You didn't do anything!

353
00:33:45,775 --> 00:33:50,179
You won't find the peanuts now.

354
00:33:50,180 --> 00:33:52,814
That's alright.

355
00:33:52,815 --> 00:33:57,051
Remember, no matter what,
we're an ace partnership.

356
00:33:57,052 --> 00:33:58,879
Forever and ever!

357
00:34:28,850 --> 00:34:30,039
I've caught White Glove.

358
00:34:32,085 --> 00:34:33,274
That's not him.

359
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,385
White Glove is blonde and blue-eyed.

360
00:34:35,489 --> 00:34:38,556
I'll bet you anything he did
the diamond job.

361
00:34:38,759 --> 00:34:40,693
He doesn't look like he's capable of that.
- No?

362
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:43,191
I know. Let me check him out.

363
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:44,825
How?

364
00:34:44,865 --> 00:34:48,557
With the latest in I.Q. testing.

365
00:34:49,136 --> 00:34:50,769
But you have to work with me.

366
00:34:55,675 --> 00:34:56,864
Please sit down.

367
00:34:58,911 --> 00:35:00,408
Leave that. Take a seat.

368
00:35:01,147 --> 00:35:04,214
I won't say a word before my lawyer arrives.

369
00:35:04,350 --> 00:35:06,245
Let's try an I.Q. test.

370
00:35:06,318 --> 00:35:08,008
After my lawyer has arrived.

371
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,888
Do you know who I am?

372
00:35:09,889 --> 00:35:10,955
Nope.

373
00:35:10,956 --> 00:35:17,561
I'm Kodojak, the famous
No. 1 Chinese inspector in the U.S.!

374
00:35:17,562 --> 00:35:19,525
You must have heard of me before!

375
00:35:19,564 --> 00:35:20,731
Oh sure!

376
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:21,899
Let's cooperate.

377
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,192
Once my lawyer arrives.

378
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:24,234
Bastard!

379
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:25,369
Give me your hand.

380
00:35:25,370 --> 00:35:26,559
You asked for it.

381
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:29,870
I haven't even started yet.

382
00:35:30,875 --> 00:35:31,908
Easy does it.

383
00:35:31,909 --> 00:35:33,098
Give it to me!

384
00:35:35,612 --> 00:35:37,370
You hear!

385
00:35:38,048 --> 00:35:39,340
Let's try the I.Q. test instead.

386
00:35:39,550 --> 00:35:42,981
This is to test reflexes.

387
00:35:43,120 --> 00:35:45,655
Whoever hits the other's hand

388
00:35:45,656 --> 00:35:47,790
is the winner.

389
00:35:48,325 --> 00:35:49,358
Who goes first?

390
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,618
Me, of course!

391
00:35:58,835 --> 00:36:00,024
Where?

392
00:36:04,607 --> 00:36:05,774
My turn.

393
00:36:05,775 --> 00:36:06,964
Can we stop now?

394
00:36:06,976 --> 00:36:08,165
Put your hand out.

395
00:36:11,481 --> 00:36:12,738
Make up your mind. Which one?

396
00:36:13,548 --> 00:36:14,582
This one.

397
00:36:14,583 --> 00:36:15,772
You're sure it's this one?

398
00:36:16,918 --> 00:36:18,085
Yeah!

399
00:36:18,086 --> 00:36:19,275
There's my lawyer!

400
00:36:27,295 --> 00:36:28,484
My turn now.

401
00:36:32,399 --> 00:36:33,691
Bastard!

402
00:36:35,669 --> 00:36:36,927
Where's my gun?

403
00:36:37,104 --> 00:36:38,293
Here.

404
00:36:41,375 --> 00:36:42,940
This isn't mine?!

405
00:36:42,977 --> 00:36:44,405
Yours is over there.

406
00:36:48,048 --> 00:36:49,272
What's wrong with you?

407
00:36:49,717 --> 00:36:53,579
I know another game.

408
00:36:53,887 --> 00:36:55,076
What if you lose again?

409
00:36:55,088 --> 00:36:56,414
I'll set you free.

410
00:36:57,757 --> 00:36:59,185
Come on.

411
00:37:00,393 --> 00:37:02,493
Grab your ear with your right hand

412
00:37:02,495 --> 00:37:05,255
and turn around your finger five times.

413
00:37:05,365 --> 00:37:08,898
Then go forward to pick up the card.

414
00:37:09,035 --> 00:37:11,269
If you lose, you'll have to work with me.

415
00:37:11,304 --> 00:37:13,368
No problem.
Show me how it's done.

416
00:37:13,372 --> 00:37:17,235
It's really simple.

417
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:23,674
Make one turn, slow and lazy.
Make two turns, simply daisy.

418
00:37:23,682 --> 00:37:27,340
Make three turns, slightly pacy.
Make four turns, getting hazy.

419
00:37:27,352 --> 00:37:30,680
Make five turns, going crazy. See?

420
00:37:31,023 --> 00:37:32,211
I got it, let's go.

421
00:37:32,390 --> 00:37:33,579
OK..

422
00:37:34,492 --> 00:37:35,525
To which side do we start?

423
00:37:35,526 --> 00:37:39,093
You're so dumb! Just turn with me.

424
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:40,463
Bit slow, isn't it?

425
00:37:40,464 --> 00:37:44,361
I can go faster. Watch this!

426
00:37:44,368 --> 00:37:45,694
That's fast. I'll never be able to make it.

427
00:37:45,703 --> 00:37:51,341
Oh, sure you can. It's my third,
fourth and fifth.

428
00:37:51,775 --> 00:37:52,964
I see. Let's start.

429
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,165
Come on.

430
00:37:54,244 --> 00:37:58,540
Make one turn, slow and lazy.
Make two turns, simply daisy.

431
00:37:58,648 --> 00:38:03,342
Make three turns, slightly pacy.
Make four turns, getting hazy.

432
00:38:03,453 --> 00:38:08,317
Make five turns, going crazy...

433
00:38:08,391 --> 00:38:09,580
Tough luck.

434
00:38:13,796 --> 00:38:14,885
Bye-bye.

435
00:38:15,998 --> 00:38:19,861
I used to do this all the time!

436
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:22,401
He's gone.
What are you up to?

437
00:38:23,105 --> 00:38:24,670
Just taking a breather.

438
00:38:59,973 --> 00:39:03,108
I'm White Glove. I've come to kill you.

439
00:39:06,380 --> 00:39:07,911
You'll have to wait.

440
00:39:08,448 --> 00:39:09,482
Why?

441
00:39:09,483 --> 00:39:11,173
Because somebody is at the door.

442
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,900
Spare me.

443
00:39:32,304 --> 00:39:33,493
Come on!

444
00:39:34,906 --> 00:39:37,973
Wait right here, I'll send my guys after you.

445
00:39:37,976 --> 00:39:39,336
Your guys?

446
00:39:45,817 --> 00:39:51,682
That's him.

447
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:22,048
He has locked himself in.

448
00:40:22,752 --> 00:40:24,886
Proceed to step two.

449
00:40:24,887 --> 00:40:26,076
Yes, Sir!

450
00:40:37,733 --> 00:40:40,800
Police?
Someone is trying to break into my flat.

451
00:40:41,003 --> 00:40:44,434
Wrong number. This is White Glove.

452
00:40:44,539 --> 00:40:46,474
I have sent you a gift.

453
00:40:46,475 --> 00:40:48,472
Go take a look at the door.

454
00:40:54,882 --> 00:40:56,671
What is it? Kerosene.

455
00:41:38,457 --> 00:41:41,592
The same way the diamonds were stolen.

456
00:42:19,429 --> 00:42:22,223
Your turn, Laurel.

457
00:43:15,115 --> 00:43:17,510
Don't be afraid, I'm right here.

458
00:43:18,619 --> 00:43:19,886
I can't get it out.

459
00:43:19,887 --> 00:43:21,076
The other way around!

460
00:43:21,321 --> 00:43:22,510
Right!

461
00:43:24,725 --> 00:43:26,415
Oh, no! Look behind you.

462
00:43:32,732 --> 00:43:35,127
You'd be dead if it weren't for me!

463
00:43:35,134 --> 00:43:36,767
Thanks for your help.

464
00:43:36,802 --> 00:43:38,026
How are you gonna pay me back?

465
00:43:38,104 --> 00:43:39,703
Wait till my lawyer arrives.

466
00:43:43,709 --> 00:43:47,003
Get me up first.

467
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:49,374
I'm investigating the diamonds case.

468
00:43:49,415 --> 00:43:50,582
I didn't do it.

469
00:43:50,583 --> 00:43:52,306
I must have got the wrong person.

470
00:43:53,485 --> 00:43:56,916
I did it. I did it...

471
00:43:57,155 --> 00:43:58,982
Where are the diamonds?

472
00:43:59,024 --> 00:44:00,213
I have no idea.

473
00:44:00,225 --> 00:44:02,950
Don't scare me, I have a weak heart.

474
00:44:02,994 --> 00:44:04,889
I'm telling you the truth.

475
00:44:04,930 --> 00:44:06,961
Where are the diamonds?

476
00:44:06,965 --> 00:44:08,154
My partner had them.

477
00:44:08,166 --> 00:44:10,334
Where is he now? He's dead.

478
00:44:10,468 --> 00:44:11,964
Don't push me too far...

479
00:44:11,969 --> 00:44:14,535
Alright... I'll help you recover
the diamonds.

480
00:44:14,605 --> 00:44:19,209
You also have to find White Glove for me.

481
00:44:19,210 --> 00:44:21,177
But you have to promise me one thing.

482
00:44:21,178 --> 00:44:22,470
What?

483
00:44:22,479 --> 00:44:23,913
Drop the charges against me.

484
00:44:23,914 --> 00:44:25,775
It's a deal.

485
00:44:25,883 --> 00:44:27,175
How can I be sure?

486
00:44:27,251 --> 00:44:28,782
I promise.

487
00:44:36,626 --> 00:44:37,815
Is the bomb ready?

488
00:44:37,827 --> 00:44:38,994
It's ready.

489
00:44:38,995 --> 00:44:40,184
Take it up.

490
00:44:40,496 --> 00:44:41,530
The bugging device?

491
00:44:41,531 --> 00:44:42,755
It's being installed.

492
00:44:42,765 --> 00:44:43,989
Who did you send?

493
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:45,322
Blabbermouth.

494
00:44:45,401 --> 00:44:47,000
Him! You can hear even his breathing
from a mile away.

495
00:44:47,237 --> 00:44:50,406
Don't you worry, not this time!

496
00:44:53,742 --> 00:44:56,103
I can't stay here a minute longer...

497
00:44:56,278 --> 00:44:58,605
It's so dead.

498
00:44:58,647 --> 00:45:00,280
Have your dinner first.

499
00:45:00,282 --> 00:45:02,541
The steak is awful.

500
00:45:02,684 --> 00:45:05,148
It tastes like cottonwood.

501
00:45:05,153 --> 00:45:06,354
You punk!

502
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:08,785
And Baldy is so lacking in manners!

503
00:45:09,291 --> 00:45:10,719
And you ask me to live with him.

504
00:45:13,694 --> 00:45:18,558
I'm suffocating in here...

505
00:45:25,006 --> 00:45:27,470
See, not a sound to the end!

506
00:45:28,042 --> 00:45:29,231
What about the bomb?

507
00:45:29,243 --> 00:45:30,569
On it's way up.

508
00:45:32,178 --> 00:45:34,209
Even the door bell sounds bad.

509
00:45:35,215 --> 00:45:36,404
What is it?

510
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:37,516
Delivery.

511
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,485
Must be my sister's. Just leave it.

512
00:45:39,486 --> 00:45:42,052
Put it down.
- Fine.

513
00:45:44,691 --> 00:45:48,156
I can't stand this, I'm going home.

514
00:45:48,228 --> 00:45:50,692
I'll be at my place if you want me.

515
00:45:57,836 --> 00:45:59,025
Hello!

516
00:45:59,138 --> 00:46:00,396
Hello!

517
00:46:00,406 --> 00:46:01,698
I live here.

518
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:03,698
Me too.

519
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:07,701
You're home, sis.

520
00:46:07,746 --> 00:46:10,881
Don't look at him. Come on in.

521
00:46:20,291 --> 00:46:23,255
Who is he?

522
00:46:23,561 --> 00:46:26,821
Him... you don't have to know him.

523
00:46:26,898 --> 00:46:29,566
This one...no, don't bother.

524
00:46:32,903 --> 00:46:34,092
Sit down.

525
00:46:34,472 --> 00:46:36,439
Didn't you say you were leaving?

526
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:38,039
Yes, go on, scram.

527
00:46:38,041 --> 00:46:40,106
Why don't you stay a while?

528
00:46:46,283 --> 00:46:48,610
Japan was a lot of fun.

529
00:46:49,486 --> 00:46:50,675
Have you been there before?

530
00:46:51,053 --> 00:46:52,242
Sure.

531
00:46:52,254 --> 00:46:53,421
On business?

532
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:55,317
Yes, on a job.

533
00:46:56,726 --> 00:47:00,528
Hush, I think he's really stuck on
your sister.

534
00:47:00,529 --> 00:47:05,166
I bet he doesn't even know his
own name now.

535
00:47:05,534 --> 00:47:06,758
What's your name?

536
00:47:06,836 --> 00:47:08,203
I have no idea.

537
00:47:08,204 --> 00:47:09,496
Did you steal the diamonds?

538
00:47:09,538 --> 00:47:11,170
I did.

539
00:47:11,172 --> 00:47:12,532
Where did you put them?

540
00:47:12,574 --> 00:47:14,575
My partner hid them.

541
00:47:14,576 --> 00:47:15,765
How can we recover them?

542
00:47:15,977 --> 00:47:19,669
He put the clue on two different women.

543
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,472
How can I find them?

544
00:47:21,549 --> 00:47:26,379
I needn't bother now that I've found you.

545
00:47:27,856 --> 00:47:30,183
You heard it, Baldy.

546
00:47:30,458 --> 00:47:33,490
I think he stole the diamonds.

547
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:34,853
Are you lying?

548
00:47:35,062 --> 00:47:40,351
I'd lie to Baldy and that bitch,
but I'd never lie to you!

549
00:47:40,434 --> 00:47:41,896
Why are you holding my hand?

550
00:47:41,902 --> 00:47:44,031
So what? We're both men!

551
00:47:44,872 --> 00:47:48,667
You heard, he knows where
the diamonds are.

552
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:52,711
You are responsible for his safety

553
00:47:52,712 --> 00:47:55,142
until we've found the diamonds.

554
00:47:55,415 --> 00:47:56,948
Oh, no! The bomb!

555
00:47:56,949 --> 00:47:58,550
Who delivered it?

556
00:47:58,551 --> 00:47:59,584
I did.

557
00:47:59,585 --> 00:48:01,377
Go bring it back, quick!

558
00:48:02,188 --> 00:48:03,755
There isn't enough time.

559
00:48:03,756 --> 00:48:04,790
Why?

560
00:48:04,791 --> 00:48:06,481
There's only time for the trip up.

561
00:48:06,492 --> 00:48:10,651
He has to be kept alive. Go get the bomb.

562
00:48:11,663 --> 00:48:13,490
Aren't you gonna leave?

563
00:48:14,766 --> 00:48:16,991
Me, leave?!

564
00:48:19,504 --> 00:48:20,932
It's much nicer here!

565
00:48:21,139 --> 00:48:22,601
See, the air is fresh.

566
00:48:22,908 --> 00:48:24,803
The steak is good, but...

567
00:48:25,110 --> 00:48:26,709
... your sis is a little too much...

568
00:48:26,845 --> 00:48:27,878
What did you say?

569
00:48:27,879 --> 00:48:29,842
Just a teeny weeny little bit.

570
00:48:29,915 --> 00:48:31,672
Even the door bell sounds good!

571
00:48:31,682 --> 00:48:33,679
I'm really enjoying the stay.

572
00:48:33,951 --> 00:48:35,084
Wrong address.

573
00:48:35,085 --> 00:48:36,411
Dumb jerk.

574
00:48:36,754 --> 00:48:38,387
Heavy shoes?!

575
00:48:38,422 --> 00:48:39,748
On your way now, please.

576
00:48:45,696 --> 00:48:47,955
Here it comes!

577
00:48:48,299 --> 00:48:50,126
Run for cover.

578
00:48:57,774 --> 00:49:00,272
All the tattoos on Joe

579
00:49:00,376 --> 00:49:02,339
were done by this guy.

580
00:49:02,645 --> 00:49:04,305
Let's hope he remembers.

581
00:49:05,748 --> 00:49:08,348
Please think carefully.

582
00:49:08,384 --> 00:49:10,847
What did he have tattooed?

583
00:49:11,286 --> 00:49:13,750
It's always a woman's name
or telephone number.

584
00:49:13,956 --> 00:49:16,989
He's got them all over his body.

585
00:49:17,025 --> 00:49:19,455
Did he bring any woman for a tattoo?

586
00:49:19,962 --> 00:49:22,221
Yes, two of them.

587
00:49:22,231 --> 00:49:25,832
And he wanted them done... here.

588
00:49:27,569 --> 00:49:29,532
What did he want tattooed?

589
00:49:29,938 --> 00:49:34,096
How can I remember? They come, they go...

590
00:49:38,112 --> 00:49:40,441
This clue's dead...

591
00:49:40,514 --> 00:49:42,395
Fat chance we have of finding
the diamonds now.

592
00:49:42,430 --> 00:49:43,916
Fat chance you have of going to jail.

593
00:49:43,951 --> 00:49:47,287
We still have another clue.

594
00:49:47,288 --> 00:49:48,288
And that is...?

595
00:49:48,289 --> 00:49:50,582
He shouted 'Rose' before he died.

596
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:53,324
I think that's the name of his girlfriend.

597
00:49:53,360 --> 00:49:54,549
Hello there.

598
00:49:54,928 --> 00:49:57,596
Did you just come out of the tattoo place?

599
00:49:57,597 --> 00:49:58,786
Yes.

600
00:49:58,798 --> 00:50:01,865
Then you must have your picture taken!

601
00:50:01,868 --> 00:50:02,902
Why?

602
00:50:02,903 --> 00:50:06,834
Everybody does it.

603
00:50:07,741 --> 00:50:09,465
Do you think...

604
00:50:09,476 --> 00:50:12,473
It's right here. Step this way.

605
00:50:13,913 --> 00:50:15,774
Rose?!

606
00:50:17,550 --> 00:50:19,741
Actually, we didn't come for
the photo session...

607
00:50:22,054 --> 00:50:24,586
Then what do you want?

608
00:50:24,657 --> 00:50:26,586
Get out!

609
00:50:27,526 --> 00:50:29,057
I came to pick up some photos for my friend.

610
00:50:29,194 --> 00:50:30,587
And who may that be?

611
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:33,060
Did anybody have a nude picture taken?

612
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,421
Burt did!

613
00:50:36,334 --> 00:50:38,331
So you're friends of Burt Reynolds?

614
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:40,728
No, we're friends of Joe.

615
00:50:41,105 --> 00:50:43,170
I don't know what you're talking about?

616
00:50:43,207 --> 00:50:45,705
The guy with all the girl's numbers
tattooed all over

617
00:50:45,710 --> 00:50:48,003
and always talking nonsense.

618
00:50:48,546 --> 00:50:51,009
I know, you mean Gigolo Joe.

619
00:50:51,014 --> 00:50:52,181
That's right!

620
00:50:52,182 --> 00:50:55,317
He only left a deposit and never came back!

621
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,743
The photos are vital to us.

622
00:50:57,754 --> 00:50:59,922
I forgot where I put them.

623
00:50:59,923 --> 00:51:01,886
I'm quite busy, you know...

624
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,081
Please look for them...

625
00:51:03,293 --> 00:51:07,224
Keep watch for me, whistle if someone
comes by.

626
00:51:12,068 --> 00:51:13,667
You're in for it now...

627
00:51:23,112 --> 00:51:24,939
What do you want? Money?

628
00:51:25,181 --> 00:51:26,370
No.

629
00:51:27,850 --> 00:51:29,176
I'm married.

630
00:51:29,552 --> 00:51:31,548
No problem.

631
00:51:31,586 --> 00:51:32,775
I am quite old.

632
00:51:32,821 --> 00:51:34,588
I am not choosy.

633
00:51:34,589 --> 00:51:35,756
I am not so pretty.

634
00:51:35,757 --> 00:51:37,481
Better than nothing.

635
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:48,296
What? A stocking!

636
00:51:48,303 --> 00:51:50,368
She can't recognize me now!

637
00:51:51,472 --> 00:51:54,368
You better put one on, too!

638
00:51:54,608 --> 00:51:55,968
Oh, no!

639
00:52:06,086 --> 00:52:08,754
I'll give you the photos!

640
00:52:13,626 --> 00:52:15,817
Terrific.

641
00:52:30,343 --> 00:52:31,531
It's all here.

642
00:52:33,979 --> 00:52:36,614
One of the girls works at this taxicab place.

643
00:52:36,615 --> 00:52:37,882
Leave the talking to me.

644
00:52:37,883 --> 00:52:38,849
Why?

645
00:52:38,850 --> 00:52:41,852
You can only handle the older dames.

646
00:52:41,853 --> 00:52:43,042
With younger ones, it's me or nothing.

647
00:52:43,321 --> 00:52:44,681
I'm not so sure.

648
00:52:44,690 --> 00:52:47,692
I was in a Body Building Contest once.

649
00:52:47,693 --> 00:52:48,726
And?

650
00:52:48,727 --> 00:52:49,894
I won, of course!

651
00:52:49,895 --> 00:52:50,860
How many entrants were there?

652
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:52,187
Just me, of course!

653
00:52:52,863 --> 00:52:54,690
Anyway, just keep your mouth shut.

654
00:52:55,332 --> 00:52:58,933
Listen, it's my case.
I get to talk to the girls.

655
00:52:59,203 --> 00:53:00,768
Hello!

656
00:53:04,709 --> 00:53:07,742
What's your problem now?

657
00:53:09,213 --> 00:53:10,777
Did you run into somebody just now?

658
00:53:11,448 --> 00:53:13,741
Hit me on the head, he did.

659
00:53:15,185 --> 00:53:17,252
Remember. I do the talking.

660
00:53:17,253 --> 00:53:18,320
No, I want to do it!

661
00:53:18,321 --> 00:53:19,354
I'll talk.

662
00:53:19,355 --> 00:53:20,155
No, I'll talk!

663
00:53:20,156 --> 00:53:21,482
Shush!
- What shush!?

664
00:53:21,524 --> 00:53:26,320
Traffic jam near Transport Department.

665
00:53:28,732 --> 00:53:30,296
Taxi service here.

666
00:53:30,532 --> 00:53:31,721
Got it.

667
00:53:32,434 --> 00:53:34,864
993, your wife wants to know if
you'll be home for dinner.

668
00:53:34,903 --> 00:53:38,439
Tell her no.
How about WE get together tonight?

669
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:40,307
Sure, but I'm busy tonight.

670
00:53:40,609 --> 00:53:42,610
Miss Mary?

671
00:53:42,611 --> 00:53:43,644
Who are you?

672
00:53:43,645 --> 00:53:46,143
I'm Joe's lawyer. This is his father.

673
00:53:46,548 --> 00:53:47,737
Pleased to meet you.

674
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:52,451
I don't know where the hell Joe's gone.

675
00:53:53,521 --> 00:53:55,720
Even you think he's gone to hell!

676
00:53:56,357 --> 00:53:58,859
He really is dead.

677
00:53:58,860 --> 00:53:59,893
Really?

678
00:53:59,894 --> 00:54:02,585
Yes, it was terrible!

679
00:54:02,597 --> 00:54:05,994
He kept calling your name before he died.

680
00:54:08,803 --> 00:54:11,732
My name?

681
00:54:17,844 --> 00:54:20,979
A lady lost her beloved Pekingese dog.

682
00:54:21,081 --> 00:54:24,216
Please call in if you find it.

683
00:54:25,051 --> 00:54:27,947
Such a sympathetic person.

684
00:54:28,155 --> 00:54:32,916
God bless the dog.

685
00:54:33,526 --> 00:54:35,125
He has left you some money.

686
00:54:36,295 --> 00:54:37,723
How much?

687
00:54:38,564 --> 00:54:40,163
Five hundred thousand!

688
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:41,661
U.S.!

689
00:54:45,704 --> 00:54:46,893
Really?

690
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:51,208
Thank God, they found the dog,
and thank Joe!

691
00:54:52,644 --> 00:54:55,677
Father, what does Joe have to do with God?

692
00:55:01,319 --> 00:55:03,487
Make yourselves at home.
Don't mention it.

693
00:55:03,855 --> 00:55:07,855
But we must have proof of your identity.

694
00:55:07,992 --> 00:55:09,557
I have my identity card.

695
00:55:09,561 --> 00:55:11,751
We understand you have...

696
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,490
... another rather unique proof.

697
00:55:13,764 --> 00:55:16,626
Did he tell you about that, too!?

698
00:55:16,700 --> 00:55:19,562
I was drunk that night.

699
00:55:19,570 --> 00:55:20,896
You like drinking?

700
00:55:21,104 --> 00:55:27,402
Yes, OK. A car has caught fire outside
the Fire Department.

701
00:55:27,444 --> 00:55:30,476
A man has been knocked down by a car
outside the Funeral Home.

702
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:31,771
What a lot of bother!

703
00:55:32,481 --> 00:55:36,515
You want to look at my behind?

704
00:55:37,787 --> 00:55:39,579
For $500,000!

705
00:55:41,224 --> 00:55:45,622
For $500,000 you can look at mine!

706
00:55:46,062 --> 00:55:48,628
This is really juicy!

707
00:55:54,803 --> 00:55:57,096
What if I won't let you?

708
00:55:57,339 --> 00:56:00,872
It will be given to his father automatically.

709
00:56:02,544 --> 00:56:04,405
Can you proof he is Joe's father?
- Yes.

710
00:56:07,449 --> 00:56:09,014
I love papa.

711
00:56:10,851 --> 00:56:12,109
Where are we going?

712
00:56:14,488 --> 00:56:20,058
Here, you can take your own picture.

713
00:56:20,561 --> 00:56:22,058
It's a bit embarrassing.

714
00:56:22,396 --> 00:56:23,722
$500.000 U.S.!

715
00:56:23,931 --> 00:56:25,120
I have no change.

716
00:56:25,966 --> 00:56:28,896
Here you are.

717
00:56:32,772 --> 00:56:34,166
Don't peep!

718
00:56:34,173 --> 00:56:38,275
Don't forget, just the mark.

719
00:56:39,445 --> 00:56:40,839
Dead!

720
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,116
It's his daughter.

721
00:56:49,122 --> 00:56:51,221
For entering the beauty contest!

722
00:57:04,403 --> 00:57:05,627
Oh, no! My brother!

723
00:57:10,441 --> 00:57:13,769
Here's your picture and your case.

724
00:57:14,278 --> 00:57:15,638
Bye-bye.

725
00:57:15,713 --> 00:57:17,005
Stop right there.

726
00:57:19,650 --> 00:57:21,647
Who are you?

727
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,719
Mad Max.

728
00:57:38,134 --> 00:57:39,528
Mad Max?!

729
00:57:41,271 --> 00:57:42,529
Who is he?

730
00:57:42,639 --> 00:57:45,569
Mad Max, who killed my partner Joe.

731
00:57:45,709 --> 00:57:47,934
I don't know him. You two carry on.

732
00:57:52,414 --> 00:57:54,047
Who are you?

733
00:57:57,619 --> 00:57:58,843
That was an accident.

734
00:58:01,924 --> 00:58:03,284
I wasn't even ready.

735
00:58:05,227 --> 00:58:07,361
Doesn't feel right.

736
00:58:08,364 --> 00:58:12,863
It's alright. There are two of us.

737
00:58:14,602 --> 00:58:17,771
Everybody knows this is my territory.

738
00:58:18,373 --> 00:58:22,134
How dare you take my sister
for obscene pictures!

739
00:58:22,510 --> 00:58:24,234
Whose idea was it?

740
00:58:24,846 --> 00:58:28,675
We may stand a chance if we both admit it.

741
00:58:28,683 --> 00:58:30,509
Is it a deal?

742
00:58:30,517 --> 00:58:31,877
Fine, no problem.

743
00:58:32,386 --> 00:58:35,020
Whose idea was it?

744
00:58:35,022 --> 00:58:36,917
Our idea.

745
00:58:36,923 --> 00:58:38,454
Who thought of the plan?

746
00:58:38,625 --> 00:58:40,918
We both did.

747
00:58:41,094 --> 00:58:43,496
Who asked my sister to do it?

748
00:58:43,497 --> 00:58:45,164
We both did.

749
00:58:45,365 --> 00:58:46,599
You have guts.

750
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,267
We both do.

751
00:58:48,635 --> 00:58:49,824
Quite something, eh?

752
00:58:50,069 --> 00:58:52,999
We both are!

753
00:59:02,815 --> 00:59:04,004
Now what?

754
00:59:04,016 --> 00:59:06,013
It'll be alright! You confess first.

755
00:59:07,219 --> 00:59:09,080
Now, whose idea was it?

756
00:59:10,388 --> 00:59:12,021
Eh, mine... for the moment.

757
00:59:15,493 --> 00:59:16,751
I can't breathe, help.

758
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,853
Did you have a part in it, too?

759
00:59:18,863 --> 00:59:20,052
Say yes. Quick!

760
00:59:20,465 --> 00:59:21,927
He said to say yes.

761
00:59:25,737 --> 00:59:28,770
Hang on, just a few more seconds.

762
00:59:32,976 --> 00:59:35,542
My turn now.

763
00:59:35,779 --> 00:59:38,209
You have a bigger nose.
It takes me longer.

764
00:59:38,482 --> 00:59:40,316
Hurry.

765
00:59:40,317 --> 00:59:41,643
Here I come.

766
00:59:44,455 --> 00:59:47,852
It feels so good.

767
00:59:48,192 --> 00:59:50,859
Hey, it's my turn now.

768
00:59:51,094 --> 00:59:52,761
Say pretty please.

769
00:59:53,563 --> 00:59:54,696
Pretty please!

770
00:59:54,697 --> 00:59:56,131
Here I come.

771
00:59:56,132 --> 00:59:59,961
Let me come down now.

772
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:02,828
What's your hurry?

773
01:00:03,072 --> 01:00:06,708
This is really killing me.

774
01:00:08,945 --> 01:00:13,137
I'll die on you. I'm dead!

775
01:00:17,719 --> 01:00:18,943
You weren't dying?!

776
01:00:19,821 --> 01:00:21,648
After you!

777
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:24,058
If I didn't say that, you wouldn't have
let me down.

778
01:00:25,293 --> 01:00:26,790
My turn now.

779
01:00:26,828 --> 01:00:29,121
No way, I want my full share of air.

780
01:00:30,197 --> 01:00:31,386
You cheat!

781
01:00:31,398 --> 01:00:34,158
Air is free. How can I cheat?!

782
01:00:34,335 --> 01:00:37,766
You, Baldy, it was all your idea!

783
01:00:39,473 --> 01:00:41,197
So, it was your idea.

784
01:00:47,781 --> 01:00:49,539
Yeah. Get him and jab one for me too.

785
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,647
Hey, we had a deal!

786
01:00:51,684 --> 01:00:54,978
Fatso, it was actually his idea.

787
01:00:56,189 --> 01:01:00,382
Did you hear him? Calling you Fatso, oh!

788
01:01:00,727 --> 01:01:04,997
It's better than you calling him Pimpy.

789
01:01:04,998 --> 01:01:06,290
What?

790
01:01:14,373 --> 01:01:17,337
Now look what you got us into.

791
01:01:17,809 --> 01:01:22,571
Don't worry. There are no trains
running here.

792
01:01:22,848 --> 01:01:24,037
No trains?!

793
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:34,150
Yeah, but we have other things that
will do fine.

794
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:10,588
We needn't be in hospital at all really.

795
01:02:10,726 --> 01:02:13,451
And you even asked for this fancy room.

796
01:02:13,696 --> 01:02:15,727
Can't you keep quiet for even one minute?

797
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:19,400
Just call me if you need anything.

798
01:02:19,401 --> 01:02:21,831
You bet... I won't.

799
01:03:11,984 --> 01:03:13,742
There are 3 of us here, you know.

800
01:03:15,621 --> 01:03:17,413
I've got other work to do.

801
01:03:24,730 --> 01:03:27,728
Wow. I think she fancies me too.
What about yours?

802
01:03:27,767 --> 01:03:29,729
I just haven't bothered!

803
01:03:29,934 --> 01:03:31,897
You sure you can tame her?

804
01:03:32,003 --> 01:03:34,034
Where the hell are those 2 bastards?!

805
01:03:34,406 --> 01:03:36,096
Speak of the devil.

806
01:03:36,574 --> 01:03:38,674
Play along with me.

807
01:03:39,010 --> 01:03:42,941
Those two, going off on their own...

808
01:03:43,081 --> 01:03:45,146
I'm going to get them!

809
01:03:46,718 --> 01:03:50,114
She really is my dreamboat!

810
01:03:51,021 --> 01:03:55,157
She looks tough but she's a real woman
from top to toe.

811
01:03:55,225 --> 01:03:57,518
Can't you see the gentle side of her?

812
01:03:57,628 --> 01:04:00,558
To tell you the truth,
I'm crazy about her.

813
01:04:01,065 --> 01:04:02,596
She is everything a man can hope for.

814
01:04:02,633 --> 01:04:05,461
She's always so poised.

815
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:08,797
Never says a harsh word to me.

816
01:04:08,972 --> 01:04:12,766
A real lady.

817
01:04:15,478 --> 01:04:20,308
She always sits so demurely.

818
01:04:20,616 --> 01:04:24,650
She's so sweet and gentle.

819
01:04:27,256 --> 01:04:28,718
Albert!

820
01:04:30,158 --> 01:04:31,518
When did you come in?

821
01:04:32,594 --> 01:04:36,697
Only just now. I wanted to tell you...

822
01:04:36,698 --> 01:04:37,887
Go on!

823
01:04:38,567 --> 01:04:40,564
Tomorrow is my birthday.

824
01:04:48,210 --> 01:04:49,398
I've got you now. I win.

825
01:04:49,944 --> 01:04:51,372
What are you doing in here again?

826
01:04:51,779 --> 01:04:53,606
I forgot my jacket.

827
01:05:10,296 --> 01:05:11,588
Sis?

828
01:05:18,438 --> 01:05:21,300
What did you do to my sister?

829
01:05:25,545 --> 01:05:30,010
I think you'd better get her an analyst.

830
01:05:31,417 --> 01:05:34,245
Hello. It's for Superintendent Ho.

831
01:05:37,790 --> 01:05:39,855
It's for your sis!

832
01:05:41,226 --> 01:05:46,159
Even I heard, from outside.

833
01:05:54,806 --> 01:05:57,201
Squealie speaking.

834
01:05:57,475 --> 01:06:02,772
Squealie, where the hell have you been?

835
01:06:03,047 --> 01:06:04,646
I told you to check out Mad Max, you Jerk.

836
01:06:04,649 --> 01:06:06,476
She'll never change.

837
01:06:06,751 --> 01:06:09,078
Oh, yes. She will, after I'm
through with her.

838
01:06:09,086 --> 01:06:10,547
What?

839
01:06:10,587 --> 01:06:13,187
Mad Max wants to get Baldy?!

840
01:06:13,490 --> 01:06:17,558
You tell him if he so much as touches
a hair on Baldy's head, I'll get him.

841
01:06:23,934 --> 01:06:25,897
Mad Max says he's going to kill you.

842
01:06:25,936 --> 01:06:27,967
So?! We're busy right now.

843
01:06:42,451 --> 01:06:43,982
The toilet isn't flushing.

844
01:06:54,329 --> 01:06:55,518
It's fixed.

845
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:11,032
It's again not working.

846
01:07:31,364 --> 01:07:33,225
OK.. Boss.

847
01:07:37,570 --> 01:07:39,237
The remote control.

848
01:07:45,878 --> 01:07:49,638
Bye-bye, Baldy!

849
01:07:51,416 --> 01:07:53,083
May the Lord be with you.

850
01:08:02,894 --> 01:08:04,493
Hey, no hanky panky with my sister.

851
01:08:08,066 --> 01:08:10,358
Watch your own hanky panky here.

852
01:08:20,811 --> 01:08:23,275
It's her birthday tonight.
I'll leave you two to it.

853
01:08:23,280 --> 01:08:24,314
And you?

854
01:08:24,315 --> 01:08:25,812
I thought you wanted to be with her.

855
01:08:26,183 --> 01:08:27,611
The truth, please.

856
01:08:28,385 --> 01:08:30,381
I've got a date.

857
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:39,360
Forgot to pay the electricity bill?

858
01:08:44,767 --> 01:08:48,869
Don't you notice anything different
about me?

859
01:08:50,205 --> 01:08:53,806
Looks like you're dressed to check out
Time Square.

860
01:08:56,511 --> 01:09:00,340
Put your leg down, gets the sofa dirty.

861
01:09:01,316 --> 01:09:03,040
It's my birthday today.

862
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:04,545
So what else is new?

863
01:09:04,987 --> 01:09:06,848
Why don't you open the champagne first?

864
01:09:32,445 --> 01:09:33,634
Did you make this?

865
01:09:34,914 --> 01:09:36,911
With my own fair hands.

866
01:09:36,983 --> 01:09:38,741
Your first attempt?

867
01:09:38,785 --> 01:09:40,475
Tastes like it!

868
01:09:45,525 --> 01:09:47,590
Your birthday, huh?
- Right.

869
01:09:47,661 --> 01:09:48,850
How old are you?

870
01:09:48,927 --> 01:09:50,253
Just 30.

871
01:09:50,362 --> 01:09:53,258
Nice age to be...

872
01:09:54,500 --> 01:09:59,103
... for a man. A bit old for a girl though,
to be still single.

873
01:10:01,173 --> 01:10:03,341
What happened?

874
01:10:04,009 --> 01:10:05,301
Mr. Right just hasn't came along yet.

875
01:10:05,678 --> 01:10:06,867
I can see why.

876
01:10:07,312 --> 01:10:08,945
Can you hear that ticking?

877
01:10:08,946 --> 01:10:10,408
There it is tick, tick.

878
01:10:10,448 --> 01:10:15,517
Hush. Tick, tick, tick. It's a bomb!

879
01:10:18,623 --> 01:10:20,791
Get down.

880
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:26,123
How come I can still hear it?

881
01:10:27,165 --> 01:10:29,389
Oh, it's my old watch.

882
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,835
You're doing this on purpose!

883
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:34,970
Temper, temper.

884
01:10:35,205 --> 01:10:38,397
You didn't have to come here.

885
01:10:38,542 --> 01:10:40,937
I only came because you asked me to.

886
01:10:40,944 --> 01:10:42,545
You think I wanted to come back.

887
01:10:42,546 --> 01:10:43,838
Where're you off to now?

888
01:10:44,147 --> 01:10:46,110
To grab some McDonald's.

889
01:10:50,119 --> 01:10:51,986
A simple yes or no...

890
01:10:51,987 --> 01:10:53,381
No!!!

891
01:10:59,361 --> 01:11:02,394
Could have asked nicely...

892
01:11:05,034 --> 01:11:06,861
Come on then.

893
01:12:36,954 --> 01:12:42,023
Where are you?

894
01:13:34,642 --> 01:13:37,709
Don't be shy. Make coffee.

895
01:13:42,750 --> 01:13:44,517
I've found the other girl.

896
01:13:44,518 --> 01:13:45,776
She's a ballet dancer.

897
01:13:45,820 --> 01:13:48,121
She's got a performance this evening,

898
01:13:48,122 --> 01:13:50,186
and is leaving for Japan tomorrow.

899
01:13:50,190 --> 01:13:51,516
We have to move tonight.

900
01:13:53,059 --> 01:13:54,293
If we two are together,

901
01:13:54,294 --> 01:13:56,553
I'm the boss, got it?

902
01:13:57,297 --> 01:13:59,158
We move tonight!

903
01:14:50,147 --> 01:14:52,440
Get a move on, you guys!

904
01:14:52,482 --> 01:14:54,081
What are you doing here?

905
01:14:57,254 --> 01:14:58,716
We're...

906
01:14:58,789 --> 01:15:00,356
... fans.

907
01:15:00,357 --> 01:15:04,015
Can't you read? No admittance!

908
01:15:07,397 --> 01:15:11,726
You there, you're on next.

909
01:15:16,105 --> 01:15:17,294
What's this swan doing here?

910
01:15:17,606 --> 01:15:18,795
She's an understudy.

911
01:15:18,808 --> 01:15:20,498
So she should be standing by.

912
01:15:20,509 --> 01:15:22,574
Hurry.

913
01:15:22,645 --> 01:15:24,107
You're in the wrong costume.

914
01:15:25,581 --> 01:15:26,907
You two again!

915
01:15:27,316 --> 01:15:29,616
Come on, after them!

916
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:32,308
Here, this way.

917
01:15:53,941 --> 01:15:57,008
Watch it!

918
01:15:58,645 --> 01:16:00,904
Are they here?

919
01:16:00,981 --> 01:16:02,546
Around here.

920
01:16:02,816 --> 01:16:04,813
It's our turn! Quick!

921
01:16:31,977 --> 01:16:33,210
You could have let us known about this,

922
01:16:33,211 --> 01:16:34,742
even though you're the best director!

923
01:16:34,746 --> 01:16:37,176
They just barged in!

924
01:16:43,956 --> 01:16:45,418
Hey, right here!

925
01:16:46,291 --> 01:16:50,586
Carry him backstage, quick!

926
01:16:55,866 --> 01:17:00,435
Let me go.

927
01:17:02,039 --> 01:17:04,867
That's the one!

928
01:17:04,942 --> 01:17:06,200
Here I come.

929
01:17:11,881 --> 01:17:12,915
OK!

930
01:17:12,916 --> 01:17:14,879
Mama.

931
01:17:15,285 --> 01:17:17,282
Not that one. It's the another one!

932
01:17:18,154 --> 01:17:19,480
Sorry!

933
01:17:19,722 --> 01:17:20,856
This one?

934
01:17:20,857 --> 01:17:24,652
That her?
- Papa!

935
01:17:35,270 --> 01:17:37,301
Oh, no! What's going on?!

936
01:17:38,674 --> 01:17:41,576
Fantastic! Great!

937
01:17:41,577 --> 01:17:45,144
They like it! They like it!

938
01:17:56,491 --> 01:17:58,215
Off the stage now.

939
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:04,359
Go back on, they like you!

940
01:18:04,866 --> 01:18:06,897
Go on!

941
01:18:07,268 --> 01:18:09,765
Shall we?
- Go, go, go.

942
01:18:09,936 --> 01:18:16,132
OK.. OK.

943
01:18:16,776 --> 01:18:20,343
Come back, Nancy!

944
01:18:21,248 --> 01:18:22,642
Down there!

945
01:18:26,286 --> 01:18:27,976
Curtain call, quick!

946
01:18:29,688 --> 01:18:31,719
Bring the curtain down.

947
01:18:33,392 --> 01:18:38,086
Great!

948
01:18:38,297 --> 01:18:39,430
That's the light bridge, idiot!

949
01:18:39,431 --> 01:18:41,565
Sorry!

950
01:18:42,334 --> 01:18:46,470
Fantastic!

951
01:18:49,541 --> 01:18:54,542
Thank you!

952
01:19:42,625 --> 01:19:43,658
What do you want?

953
01:19:43,659 --> 01:19:47,522
Don't dilly dally! Get on with it!

954
01:19:47,563 --> 01:19:49,252
Over there!

955
01:19:58,506 --> 01:19:59,968
Don't stare!

956
01:20:17,324 --> 01:20:18,821
Cheers!

957
01:20:21,996 --> 01:20:23,595
According to my analysis,

958
01:20:23,664 --> 01:20:27,197
Joe made these tattoos.

959
01:20:27,434 --> 01:20:30,568
Take away the hearts and

960
01:20:30,637 --> 01:20:33,135
if you read across...

961
01:20:33,273 --> 01:20:34,531
... you'll see that it says.

962
01:20:36,242 --> 01:20:37,932
M A P

963
01:20:38,044 --> 01:20:39,077
A map.

964
01:20:39,078 --> 01:20:40,212
Right.

965
01:20:40,213 --> 01:20:42,745
Joe also kept saying 'Kowloon'.

966
01:20:43,016 --> 01:20:45,309
So now, let's look at a Kowloon map.

967
01:20:48,987 --> 01:20:50,950
The clue is in P6.

968
01:20:51,957 --> 01:20:56,059
This is P and 6.

969
01:20:58,363 --> 01:20:59,397
It's in the middle of the sea.

970
01:20:59,398 --> 01:21:00,464
Right!

971
01:21:00,465 --> 01:21:03,657
What does the rest stand for?

972
01:21:03,769 --> 01:21:04,958
What?

973
01:21:05,304 --> 01:21:07,438
Your guess is as good as mine.

974
01:21:09,240 --> 01:21:12,102
There's B3!

975
01:21:12,209 --> 01:21:13,343
Right!

976
01:21:13,344 --> 01:21:15,910
Old Joe wasn't so dumb after all.

977
01:21:15,913 --> 01:21:16,946
Bit like it...

978
01:21:16,947 --> 01:21:18,910
The diamonds must be under the buoy.

979
01:21:18,949 --> 01:21:20,138
Naturally.

980
01:21:21,886 --> 01:21:23,713
But I can't swim.

981
01:21:23,721 --> 01:21:24,754
Neither can I.

982
01:21:24,755 --> 01:21:26,650
It's never too late to start learning!

983
01:21:28,425 --> 01:21:29,758
See, you're doing just fine!

984
01:21:29,759 --> 01:21:31,017
You're really something.

985
01:21:41,738 --> 01:21:44,463
I've got it.

986
01:21:58,887 --> 01:22:00,714
After them!

987
01:22:01,190 --> 01:22:03,688
Don't bother. The real ones are here.

988
01:22:04,159 --> 01:22:05,348
Hey, you're really good.

989
01:22:14,369 --> 01:22:16,036
Damn Baldy.

990
01:22:23,478 --> 01:22:24,544
Just in time.

991
01:22:24,545 --> 01:22:26,440
Here are the diamonds. Can I go free now?

992
01:22:26,547 --> 01:22:27,736
Sure thing.

993
01:22:28,348 --> 01:22:29,572
What are you doing here?

994
01:22:30,050 --> 01:22:32,047
I brought you your car.

995
01:22:32,052 --> 01:22:35,221
Don't get in the way!

996
01:22:35,222 --> 01:22:36,514
White Glove won't show up
if he smells the cops.

997
01:22:36,857 --> 01:22:39,617
Just call me, I've got the whole force ready.

998
01:22:40,494 --> 01:22:41,527
Yeah, yeah. Now get a move on.

999
01:22:41,528 --> 01:22:42,717
Run a hot bath for me!

1000
01:22:42,763 --> 01:22:43,952
OK..

1001
01:22:46,666 --> 01:22:51,393
Albert, you'll catch a cold
if you don't change soon.

1002
01:22:53,105 --> 01:22:56,763
Don't kid me. You just want to keep
a check on me.

1003
01:22:58,411 --> 01:22:59,600
That should get rid of her.

1004
01:23:02,081 --> 01:23:03,248
Ready.
- Anytime you are.

1005
01:23:03,249 --> 01:23:03,915
Hurry.

1006
01:23:03,916 --> 01:23:05,105
All set.

1007
01:23:17,529 --> 01:23:20,391
Didn't you say you have a trump card?

1008
01:23:20,765 --> 01:23:24,332
At the right time. It's either you
or him now.

1009
01:23:24,502 --> 01:23:25,536
What about you?

1010
01:23:25,537 --> 01:23:27,261
I'll just watch.

1011
01:23:36,580 --> 01:23:39,715
There's White Glove, hurry!

1012
01:23:59,936 --> 01:24:01,831
I think he's had it now.

1013
01:24:04,841 --> 01:24:07,339
Not fair for him. It's us two against him!

1014
01:24:07,776 --> 01:24:09,637
OK, Baldy, all yours!

1015
01:24:09,678 --> 01:24:10,778
What about you?

1016
01:24:10,779 --> 01:24:12,913
You can handle this. It's nothing.

1017
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,727
I think you'd better get ready too.

1018
01:24:36,837 --> 01:24:40,404
You can call Ho on the walkie talkie now.

1019
01:24:40,474 --> 01:24:41,663
Call who? What?

1020
01:24:41,775 --> 01:24:43,169
Call Superintendent Ho!

1021
01:24:43,177 --> 01:24:44,210
I threw the damn thing away!

1022
01:24:44,211 --> 01:24:45,011
Oh!

1023
01:24:45,012 --> 01:24:47,271
But you have a trump card.

1024
01:24:47,281 --> 01:24:48,742
It's not here!

1025
01:25:22,681 --> 01:25:25,616
Oh, no! Let me do the driving!

1026
01:25:25,617 --> 01:25:27,647
Don't mess around.
Come on, I'm better.

1027
01:25:30,021 --> 01:25:31,210
Watch it. Careful!

1028
01:25:33,658 --> 01:25:34,691
Let me.

1029
01:25:34,692 --> 01:25:36,052
Don't move!

1030
01:25:37,328 --> 01:25:39,223
Stop the car!

1031
01:25:39,363 --> 01:25:41,428
Put it in reverse.

1032
01:25:44,502 --> 01:25:47,170
We surrender.

1033
01:25:58,448 --> 01:26:02,744
You're as bad as your car looks.

1034
01:26:03,119 --> 01:26:05,549
You want to do the honours?

1035
01:26:08,524 --> 01:26:09,713
Through here.

1036
01:26:09,825 --> 01:26:11,151
Wow!

1037
01:26:25,207 --> 01:26:26,704
You're doing just fine, kiddo!

1038
01:26:43,725 --> 01:26:46,026
I see a lot of stars.

1039
01:26:46,027 --> 01:26:47,060
Are you OK?

1040
01:26:47,061 --> 01:26:47,693
Just fine.

1041
01:26:47,694 --> 01:26:49,521
Over there, quick.

1042
01:26:54,001 --> 01:26:55,034
What's this?

1043
01:26:55,035 --> 01:26:55,735
Digging for cover.

1044
01:26:55,736 --> 01:26:56,925
Good idea.

1045
01:27:01,441 --> 01:27:02,475
What's this?

1046
01:27:02,476 --> 01:27:03,973
My trump card.

1047
01:27:57,327 --> 01:27:58,361
This is fun!

1048
01:27:58,362 --> 01:27:59,551
Careful now.

1049
01:28:17,780 --> 01:28:18,969
Let me have a go.

1050
01:28:19,015 --> 01:28:20,204
Get off.

1051
01:28:32,527 --> 01:28:33,716
That's one trying to get away!

1052
01:28:36,064 --> 01:28:36,997
Let me do it.

1053
01:28:36,998 --> 01:28:38,187
Get off.

1054
01:28:49,577 --> 01:28:50,937
Hey, what a lot of fun.

1055
01:28:51,679 --> 01:28:52,903
Watch that one.

1056
01:28:57,384 --> 01:28:58,642
Are you alright?

1057
01:28:59,153 --> 01:29:00,615
I'm fine.

1058
01:29:02,823 --> 01:29:04,513
But I'm not.

1059
01:29:08,027 --> 01:29:09,216
Are you OK?

1060
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:43,515
Help, I can't swim.

1061
01:30:49,090 --> 01:30:54,023
Let's break this up, move!

1062
01:30:55,630 --> 01:30:57,531
Let's break this up, move!

1063
01:30:57,532 --> 01:30:58,565
How is he?

1064
01:30:58,566 --> 01:31:01,735
Break it up!

1065
01:31:02,237 --> 01:31:03,937
Come down.

1066
01:31:03,938 --> 01:31:05,127
Let him ride with his pal.

1067
01:31:09,176 --> 01:31:10,741
Doctor, his pal's come on board, too.

1068
01:31:11,278 --> 01:31:15,812
It's OK, one's crazy and one's a local.

1069
01:31:15,916 --> 01:31:21,611
A fine pair!

1070
01:31:36,769 --> 01:31:38,231
Thank you.

1071
01:31:46,646 --> 01:31:50,611
Big man like you, sob, sob!

1072
01:31:52,183 --> 01:31:53,816
Getting mad?

1073
01:31:54,152 --> 01:31:57,480
Any troubles you have,
you can share them with me.

1074
01:31:57,589 --> 01:32:00,690
Let's sit down and talk it over.

1075
01:32:00,959 --> 01:32:04,993
If you need help, I'll be right here

1076
01:32:05,096 --> 01:32:09,493
at your beck and call.

1077
01:32:09,667 --> 01:32:12,859
With you by my side, I'll never be afraid.

1078
01:32:13,003 --> 01:32:16,263
United we're strong,

1079
01:32:16,407 --> 01:32:18,165
I'll look after you.

1080
01:32:18,342 --> 01:32:20,169
Have no fears, rest assured.

1081
01:32:20,311 --> 01:32:23,674
What a pair we make.

1082
01:32:44,000 --> 01:32:47,532
Any troubles you have,
you can share them with me.

1083
01:32:47,636 --> 01:32:50,862
Let's sit down and talk it over.

1084
01:32:51,373 --> 01:32:54,940
If you need help, I'll be right here

1085
01:32:55,010 --> 01:32:59,112
at your beck and call.

1086
01:32:59,114 --> 01:33:02,750
With you by my side, I'll never be afraid.

1087
01:33:02,851 --> 01:33:06,248
United we're strong,

1088
01:33:06,488 --> 01:33:08,177
I'll look after you.

1089
01:33:08,356 --> 01:33:10,080
Have no fears, rest assured.

1090
01:33:10,191 --> 01:33:12,359
What a pair we make.

1091
01:33:12,360 --> 01:33:16,029
That's what we are.

1092
01:33:16,030 --> 01:33:20,428
Always a pair of aces.

1093
01:33:20,428 --> 01:35:20,428
