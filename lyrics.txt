Michael Jackson - Thriller
---
[Verse 1: Michael Jackson]
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed

[Chorus 1: Michael Jackson]
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh

Marvin Gaye - Ain't Nothing like the Real Thing (some lines removed @ end)
---
[Hook: Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Tammi]
I got your picture hangin' on the wall
But it can't see or come to me when I call your name
I realize it's just a picture in a frame

[Marvin]
I read your letters when you're not here
But they don't move me and they don't groove me like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear

[Hook]
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

[Tammi]
I play the game, of fantasy
I pretend but I know in reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

[Marvin and Tammi]
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
[Marvin]: To make me feel better
[Tammi]: So let's stay together

[Marvin]
I got some memories to look back on
And though they help me when you phone, I'm well aware
Nothing can take your place of being there

[Hook]
So let me get the real thing
So let me get the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

Laura Pausini - The Extra Mile
---
Countless eyes are watching
In this our finest hour
It's time to realize the dream
Of who we really are

I'm gonna freeze this space and time
Rise to meet the call
Seize the moment, make it mine
And through it all

Straight as the arrow flies
I will run towards the finish line
With all the strength I've found
My feet won't touch the ground
I will scale the heights if I believe
Your wings of faith will carry me
I'll go the distance just to reach
The arms I'm running to
I'll go the extra mile for you

I know it won't be easy
To make you understand
I wanna take the glory
And put it in your hands

'Cause you're the light that makes me shine
You're the hero in my eyes
Win or lose, do or die
I am aiming high

Straight as the arrows flies
I will run towards the finish line
With all the strength I've found
My feet won't touch the ground
I will scale the heights if I believe
Your wings of faith will carry me
I'll go the distance just to reach
The arms I'm running to
I'll go the extra mile for you

(Go the extra mile) In the end
(Go the extra mile) I wanna be able to say
I gave all of me for the world to see
And I would do it all again
I'd go the extra mile

(Straight as the arrows flies)
(I will run towards the finish line)
(With all the strength I've found) all the strength I've found
My feet won't touch the ground
I will scale the heights if I believe
Your wings of faith will carry me
I'll go the distance just to reach
The arms I'm running to
I'll go the extra mile for you

Knowing it would be worthwhile
I will go the extra mile for you
